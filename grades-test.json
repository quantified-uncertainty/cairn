      "llmSummary": "This meta-page provides transparency about the wiki's creation using AI assistance, its perspective from within the AI safety community, and acknowledges significant biases including coverage gaps in AI ethics perspectives and structural biases favoring x-risk arguments. The page demonstrates unusual epistemic humility by explicitly listing assumptions, limitations, and conflicts of interest.",
      "reasoning": "This is internal documentation about the wiki itself rather than substantive AI safety content. While well-executed with good transparency practices, it doesn't inform prioritization decisions about AI interventions or risks. Falls into 'internal/infrastructure' category with -30 adjustment from a base score around 45."

      "llmSummary": "This is a navigation page that displays topic tags for browsing entities in the knowledge base, using both cloud and alphabetical list formats. It serves as an organizational tool but contains no substantive content for AI safety prioritization.",
      "reasoning": "This is purely a navigation/infrastructure page with no substantive content. While it may help users find relevant information, it doesn't contain any analysis, interventions, or insights that would inform prioritization decisions. Applied -30 adjustment for internal/infrastructure category, resulting in very low importance for expert prioritization work."

Provides navigation features like pan/zoom and shows graph statistics including most connected entities and orphaned nodes.",
      "reasoning": "This is purely internal infrastructure for navigating the knowledge base - a dashboard tool rather than substantive content about AI safety. While technically competent, it has no direct relevance to prioritization decisions or AI risk assessment. Falls clearly in the peripheral category with the -30 adjustment for internal/infrastructure tools."

      "llmSummary": "This FAQ addresses common misconceptions about AI safety and existential risk, explaining core concepts like alignment and instrumental convergence while citing expert consensus from surveys showing over 50% of AI researchers assign >5% probability to catastrophic risk. It systematically refutes objections like 'just turn it off' and distinguishes AI safety from AI ethics.",
      "reasoning": "Well-crafted reference material that would help newcomers understand AI safety concepts and expert positions, but primarily serves an educational/onboarding function rather than directly informing prioritization decisions. The -15 adjustment for being introductory content brings it to the reference material range, though the quality of explanations and expert citations keeps it from being lower."

      "llmSummary": "Provides a structured curriculum for newcomers to AI safety with 5-minute, 30-minute, 2-hour, and full-day reading paths, covering core arguments, risk estimates (5-90% catastrophic risk), timelines (median 2040), and current workforce size (300-1000 people). Serves as a well-organized entry point but doesn't contain novel prioritization insights.",
      "reasoning": "This is high-quality educational infrastructure that helps onboard newcomers systematically. However, it's primarily a navigation/reference tool rather than containing actionable prioritization content. The structured learning paths and key statistics (risk estimates, timelines, workforce size) provide useful context, but this falls into the reference material category with -15 adjustment for being primarily about guiding people rather than direct intervention content."
