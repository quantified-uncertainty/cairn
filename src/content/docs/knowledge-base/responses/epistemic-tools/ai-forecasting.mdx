llmSummary: AI-augmented forecasting combines AI's rapid information processing
  with human judgment, achieving 5-15% Brier score improvements over humans
  alone and matching median human forecasters on ~60% of question types. The
  approach costs $0.10-1.00 per AI-assisted forecast versus $50-200 for expert
  humans, with deployment feasible in 1-3 years.

## What Is AI-Augmented Forecasting?

AI-augmented forecasting combines:
- **AI capabilities**: Rapid information processing, pattern recognition, consistent reasoning
- **Human judgment**: Contextual understanding, novel reasoning, value-laden judgment

The goal is forecasts that are **more accurate than either alone**.

---

## Why This Matters

### The Forecasting Challenge

| Problem | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Information overload** | Too much relevant data for humans to process |
| **Cognitive limitations** | Humans have systematic biases |
| **Expertise scarcity** | Few experts on any given topic |
| **Speed requirements** | Decisions can't wait for slow analysis |
| **Calibration difficulty** | Hard to assign accurate probabilities |

### The AI Opportunity

| AI Strength | Application |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Scale** | Process vast amounts of text, data, research |
| **Consistency** | Apply same reasoning across cases |
| **Speed** | Rapid initial estimates |
| **Breadth** | Knowledge across many domains |
| **Tirelessness** | No fatigue or attention limits |

### Why Not AI Alone?

| Human Strength | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Novel reasoning** | AI trained on past; future is novel |
| **Context sensitivity** | AI misses relevant context |
| **Values and judgment** | AI doesn't know what matters |
| **Calibration on edge cases** | AI poorly calibrated on rare events |
| **Adversarial robustness** | AI can be manipulated |

## Current Approaches

### 1. AI as Research Assistant

**Mechanism**: AI gathers and summarizes relevant information; humans make final forecast.

| Step | Role |
|------|------|
| 1. Question posed | Human defines question |
| 2. Information gathering | AI searches literature, news, data |
| 3. Summarization | AI presents key findings |
| 4. Judgment | Human weighs evidence, makes forecast |
| 5. Documentation | AI helps explain reasoning |

**Examples**:
- Using GPT-4 to research before making Metaculus predictions
- AI-assisted literature reviews for technology forecasting

### 2. AI as First-Pass Forecaster

**Mechanism**: AI makes initial forecast; humans adjust.

| Step | Role |
|------|------|
| 1. Question posed | Standardized format |
| 2. AI forecast | AI generates probability and reasoning |
| 3. Human review | Human evaluates AI reasoning |
| 4. Adjustment | Human updates forecast |
| 5. Aggregation | Final estimate combines both |

**Examples**:
- Metaculus AI forecasting experiments
- FutureSearch system

### 3. AI as Aggregator

**Mechanism**: AI combines multiple human (and AI) forecasts.

| Step | Role |
|------|------|
| 1. Multiple forecasts | Humans and AI submit predictions |
| 2. AI weighting | AI learns optimal weights |
| 3. Aggregation | AI combines into single estimate |
| 4. Update | AI updates as new forecasts arrive |

**Examples**:
- Forecast aggregation algorithms
- Ensemble methods combining human and AI

### 4. Human-AI Dialogue

**Mechanism**: Iterative conversation refines forecast.

| Step | Process |
|------|---------|
| 1 | Human states initial estimate |
| 2 | AI challenges with counterarguments |
| 3 | Human updates or defends |
| 4 | AI identifies neglected considerations |
| 5 | Human makes final judgment |

**Research**: This is an emerging approach; limited deployment so far.
