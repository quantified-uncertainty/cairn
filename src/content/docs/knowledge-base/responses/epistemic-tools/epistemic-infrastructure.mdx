## What Is Epistemic Infrastructure?

Epistemic infrastructure refers to the **systems, institutions, and technologies** that enable societies to:
- Create reliable knowledge
- Verify claims and evidence
- Preserve knowledge over time
- Distribute knowledge fairly
- Maintain shared understanding

Just as physical infrastructure (roads, power grids) enables economic activity, epistemic infrastructure enables collective reasoning.

## Why We Need It

### The Current State

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fragmented verification** | Each platform/outlet does own fact-checking |
| **No shared knowledge base** | Different sources say different things |
| **Commercial incentives** | Engagement > accuracy |
| **Skill atrophy** | Fewer people can evaluate claims |
| **Platform dependence** | Knowledge locked in private systems |

### What Good Infrastructure Enables

| Function | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Scalable verification** | Check claims across contexts |
| **Shared reference** | Common source of agreed facts |
| **Quality signals** | Know what's reliable |
| **Preservation** | Knowledge survives institutional failure |
| **Access** | Everyone can reach knowledge |

## Components of Epistemic Infrastructure

### 1. Knowledge Bases

**Purpose**: Structured, machine-readable knowledge with provenance.

| Type | Examples | Strengths |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **General encyclopedias** | Wikipedia | Broad coverage |
| **Domain knowledge bases** | Wikidata, DBpedia | Structured data |
| **Research databases** | Semantic Scholar, PubMed | Academic knowledge |
| **Claim databases** | ClaimReview, Fact-check repositories | Verified claims |

**AI enhancement**:
- Automated extraction from sources
- Consistency checking
- Gap identification
- Multi-language synthesis

### 2. Verification Networks

**Purpose**: Distributed fact-checking with shared standards.

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Fact-checking organizations** | Original investigation |
| **ClaimReview markup** | Standard for fact-check results |
| **Cross-referencing** | Multiple checks per claim |
| **Aggregation** | Synthesize across checkers |

**Key players**:
- [International Fact-Checking Network](https://www.poynter.org/ifcn/)
- [ClaimReview schema](https://schema.org/ClaimReview)
- [Google Fact Check Tools](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/)

**AI enhancement**:
- Automated claim detection
- Source gathering
- Similar claim identification
- Prioritization of claims to check

### 3. Reputation Systems

**Purpose**: Track reliability of sources over time.

| Approach | Description | Examples |

| **Expert ratings** | Experts evaluate sources | NewsGuard |
| **Track records** | Historical accuracy | Metaculus scores |
| **Peer evaluation** | rate each other | Academic peer review |
| **Crowd sourcing** | Aggregate user assessments | Community Notes |

**Key systems**:
- [NewsGuard](https://www.newsguardtech.com/) — News source ratings
- [Ad Fontes Media Bias Chart](https://adfontesmedia.com/) — Bias ratings
- Community Notes (X/Twitter) — Crowd-sourced context

### 4. Provenance Systems

**Purpose**: Track where information came from.

| Level | What It Tracks |
|-------|----------------|
| **Source** | Original creator/publication |
| **Citations** | What sources cite what |
| **Modifications** | How content was changed |
| **Distribution** | How information spread |

**Key systems**:
- [C2PA](https://c2pa.org/) — Content credentials
- Citation graphs — Academic provenance
- Web archiving — Historical preservation

### 5. Preservation Systems

**Purpose**: Ensure knowledge survives over time.

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Internet Archive** | Web snapshots |
| **Academic archives** | Research preservation |
| **Decentralized storage** | Censorship resistance |
| **Version control** | Change history |

**Key players**:
- [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)
- [Perma.cc](https://perma.cc/) — Link preservation
- LOCKSS, CLOCKSS — Library archiving

### 6. Access Systems

**Purpose**: Ensure knowledge is accessible.

| Barrier | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Paywalls** | Open access, Sci-Hub |
| **Language** | Translation, multilingual content |
| **Complexity** | Plain language summaries |
| **Connectivity** | Offline access, low-bandwidth versions |

| **Verification** | Cross-check claims against sources |
| **Gap-finding** | Identify missing knowledge |

### Risks of AI in Infrastructure

| Risk | Concern |
|------|---------|
| **Hallucination** | AI invents false information |
| **Bias propagation** | AI amplifies training biases |
| **Homogenization** | Same AI answers everywhere |
| **Accountability** | Who's responsible for AI errors? |
| **Dependency** | Infrastructure depends on AI providers |

### Design Principles for AI Integration

| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Human oversight** | AI assists, doesn't replace |
| **Transparency** | Know when AI is involved |
| **Diverse AI** | Multiple systems reduce correlated errors |
| **Auditability** | AI contributions are traceable |
| **Graceful degradation** | Works if AI fails |

## Current Gaps

### What's Missing

| Gap | Why It Matters |
|-----|----------------|
| **Cross-platform verification** | Claims spread across platforms; verification doesn't |
| **Real-time synthesis** | Knowledge updates faster than infrastructure |
| **Global coverage** | Most infrastructure is Western/English |
| **Incentive alignment** | Verification isn't profitable |
| **Governance** | Who controls the infrastructure? |

### Research Priorities

| Priority | Question |
|----------|----------|
| **Scalable verification** | How to verify at internet scale? |
| **Adversarial robustness** | How to resist manipulation? |
| **Incentive design** | How to fund ongoing operation? |
| **Governance models** | How to ensure legitimacy? |
| **AI integration** | How to safely use AI? |
