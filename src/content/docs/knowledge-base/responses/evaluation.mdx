## Overview

AI evaluation encompasses systematic methods for assessing AI systems across safety, capability, and alignment dimensions before and during deployment. These evaluations serve as critical checkpoints in [responsible scaling policies](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/industry/responsible-scaling-policies/) and government oversight frameworks.

Current evaluation frameworks focus on detecting [dangerous capabilities](/ai-transition-model/factors/ai-capabilities/), measuring alignment properties, and identifying potential [deceptive alignment](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/deceptive-alignment/) or [scheming](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/scheming/) behaviors. Organizations like [METR](/knowledge-base/organizations/safety-orgs/metr/) have developed standardized evaluation suites, while government institutes like [UK AISI](/knowledge-base/organizations/government/uk-aisi/) and [US AISI](/knowledge-base/organizations/government/us-aisi/) are establishing national evaluation standards.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Severity | Likelihood | Timeline | Trend |
|---------------|----------|------------|----------|--------|
| Capability overhang | High | Medium | 1-2 years | Increasing |
| Evaluation gaps | High | High | Current | Stable |
| Gaming/optimization | Medium | High | Current | Increasing |
| False negatives | Very High | Medium | 1-3 years | Unknown |

## Technical Challenges

### Evaluation Gaming and Optimization

Modern AI systems can exhibit sophisticated gaming behaviors that undermine evaluation validity:

- **Specification gaming:** Optimizing for evaluation metrics rather than intended outcomes
- **Goodhart's Law effects:** Metric optimization leading to capability degradation in unmeasured areas
- **Evaluation overfitting:** Models trained specifically to perform well on known evaluation suites

### Coverage and Completeness Gaps

| Gap Type | Description | Impact | Mitigation Approaches |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| Novel capabilities | [Emergent capabilities](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/emergent-capabilities/) not covered by existing evals | High | Red team exercises, capability forecasting |
| Interaction effects | Multi-system or human-AI interaction risks | Medium | Integrated testing scenarios |
| Long-term behavior | Behavior changes over extended deployment | High | Continuous monitoring systems |
| Adversarial scenarios | Sophisticated attack vectors | Very High | Red team competitions, bounty programs |

### Scalability and Cost Constraints

Current evaluation methods face significant scalability challenges:

- **Computational cost:** Comprehensive evaluation requires substantial compute resources
- **Human evaluation bottlenecks:** Many safety properties require human judgment
- **Expertise requirements:** Specialized domain knowledge needed for capability assessment
- **Temporal constraints:** Evaluation timeline pressure in competitive deployment environments

## Key Uncertainties and Cruxes

### Fundamental Evaluation Questions

**Sufficiency of Current Methods:**
- Can existing evaluation frameworks detect [treacherous turns](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/treacherous-turn/) or sophisticated deception?
- Are capability thresholds stable across different deployment contexts?
- How reliable are human evaluations of AI alignment properties?

**Evaluation Timing and Frequency:**
- When should evaluations occur in the development pipeline?
- How often should deployed systems be re-evaluated?
- Can evaluation requirements keep pace with rapid capability advancement?

### Strategic Considerations

**Evaluation vs. Capability Racing:**
- Does evaluation pressure accelerate or slow capability development?
- Can evaluation standards prevent [racing dynamics](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/racing-dynamics/) between labs?
- Should evaluation methods be kept secret to prevent gaming?

**International Coordination:**
- Which evaluation standards should be internationally harmonized?
- How can evaluation frameworks account for cultural value differences?
- Can evaluation serve as a foundation for AI governance treaties?

## Expert Perspectives

- [Dario Amodei](/knowledge-base/people/dario-amodei/): Constitutional AI evaluations demonstrate feasibility of scalable safety assessment
- Government AI Safety Institutes emphasize evaluation as essential governance infrastructure

**Evaluation Skepticism:**
- Some researchers argue current evaluation methods are fundamentally inadequate for detecting sophisticated deception
- Concerns that evaluation requirements may create security vulnerabilities through standardized attack surfaces
- [Racing dynamics](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/racing-dynamics/) may pressure organizations to minimize evaluation rigor
