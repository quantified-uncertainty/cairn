## Key Developments

### AI Safety Institutes (AISIs)

A new institutional model emerging from 2023:
- **UK AISI** (November 2023) - First major national AI safety institute
- **US AISI** (February 2024) - Within NIST
- **International network** - Seoul Summit agreement for coordination

### Standards Landscape

Multiple bodies developing AI standards:
- **ISO/IEC** - International standards (ISO 42001 for AI management)
- **IEEE** - Technical and ethics standards (7000 series)
- **CEN-CENELEC** - EU harmonized standards for AI Act compliance
- **NIST** - US frameworks (AI RMF)

## Relationship to Other Responses

Institutions support other response categories:
- **Technical research** - AISIs conduct safety research
- **Governance** - Standards inform regulation; institutes advise policy
- **Coordination** - International networks enable cooperation
