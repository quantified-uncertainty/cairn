:::note[Part of Compute Governance]
This page covers **compute monitoring**—one approach within the broader [Compute Governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/) framework. See also: [Export Controls](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/export-controls/), [Thresholds](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/thresholds/), [International Regimes](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/international-regimes/).

## Overview

Compute monitoring creates **ongoing visibility** into who's training large AI models. Unlike export controls (which deny access) or thresholds (which trigger requirements), monitoring is about **knowing what's happening**—enabling detection, verification, and response.

This includes:
- **Cloud KYC (Know Your Customer):** Cloud providers verify customers and report large training runs
- **Hardware-level governance:** Chips with built-in monitoring capabilities
- **Verification systems:** Cryptographic attestation of what's running

Monitoring is the foundation for enforcement of other compute governance measures.

### Quick Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Tractability | Medium-High (cloud) / Low-Medium (hardware) | Cloud KYC implementable now; hardware governance is longer-term |
| Current Status | Early implementation | US EO includes KYC requirements; hardware governance is research-stage |
| Main Challenge | Privacy vs. oversight balance | Monitoring infrastructure could enable surveillance |
| Time Horizon | Near-term (cloud) / Long-term (hardware) | Different timelines for different approaches |

### Risks Addressed

| Risk | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| [Proliferation](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/proliferation/) | Visibility into who's training large models | Medium-High |
| [Racing Dynamics](/knowledge-base/risk-factors/racing-dynamics/) | Enables verification of commitments | Medium |
| [Bioweapons](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/bioweapons/) | Detect training runs focused on biological capabilities | Medium |

## Cloud KYC (Know Your Customer)

### How It Works

Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) are the primary access point for AI training compute. KYC requirements would have them:

**Customer Verification:**
- Identity verification for large compute customers
- Purpose of use declarations
- Ongoing monitoring of usage patterns

**Reporting Obligations:**
- Report training runs above threshold (e.g., 10^23 FLOP)
- Report to government authorities
- Suspicious activity reporting

**Access Controls:**
- Deny service to blocked entities
- Geographic restrictions
- Capability-based access tiers

### Current Status

**US Executive Order 14110** includes KYC requirements:
- Cloud providers must report large training runs
- Customer verification requirements
- Being developed by major cloud providers

**Implementation challenges:**
- International cloud providers and jurisdictions
- On-premise clusters (not covered)
- Privacy and proprietary information concerns

### Advantages

- **Concentrated chokepoints:** Few major cloud providers
- **Already regulated:** Cloud providers are in regulable jurisdictions
- **Existing infrastructure:** KYC systems exist for financial compliance

### Limitations

- **On-premise compute:** Organizations with their own hardware are not covered
- **International arbitrage:** Training in less-regulated jurisdictions
- **Privacy concerns:** Detailed monitoring of customer activities

## Hardware-Level Governance

### The Vision

Build governance capabilities **directly into AI chips**, enabling:

**Chip Registration:**
- Each advanced AI chip has unique identifier
- Registered with manufacturer or government
- Trackable through supply chain

**On-Chip Monitoring:**
- Chips report usage data
- Training run logging
- Encrypted and secured reporting

**Remote Attestation:**
- Chips cryptographically prove what they're running
- Enable verification of compliance
- Prevent unauthorized use

**Remote Controls (controversial):**
- Ability to disable chips remotely
- Highly controversial due to security risks
- Likely politically infeasible

### Current Status

**Mostly research/proposal stage:**
- Some chip security features exist (TPM, secure enclaves)
- No AI-specific governance features implemented
- Major technical and political challenges remain

**Key research:**
- Centre for the Governance of AI (GovAI) proposals
- Academic work on secure hardware
- Industry exploration (limited public information)

### Technical Challenges

**Backward compatibility:**
- Existing chips lack governance features
- Long replacement cycles for hardware

**Performance overhead:**
- Monitoring consumes resources
- May create competitive disadvantage

**Security of monitoring systems:**
- Monitoring infrastructure could be hacked
- Creates new attack surface
- Single point of failure risks

**Chip complexity:**
- Adding features increases manufacturing difficulty
- Cost implications

### Political Challenges

**Privacy concerns:**
- Detailed monitoring of computing activity
- Potential for surveillance abuse
- Civil liberties implications

**Industry resistance:**
- Costs of implementation
- Competitive disadvantage for compliant manufacturers
- Complex supply chain changes

**International acceptance:**
- Would require coordination across manufacturing countries
- China unlikely to adopt US-designed governance chips
- Creates bifurcated hardware ecosystems

## Verification and Attestation

### The Problem

How do you verify that someone is actually complying with compute governance requirements?

**Self-reporting limitations:**
- Labs report their own compute usage
- Incentives to underreport
- Difficult to verify claims

### Technical Solutions

**Cryptographic attestation:**
- Hardware proves what software it's running
- Can verify training configurations
- Resistant to tampering

**Trusted execution environments:**
- Secure enclaves for sensitive computation
- Can log activities securely
- Existing technology (Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone)

**Compute accounting:**
- Track cumulative compute usage
- Hardware-enforced limits
- Tamper-evident logging

### Challenges

**Cat-and-mouse dynamics:**
- Sophisticated actors may circumvent verification
- Verification systems need continuous updating
- Arms race between governance and evasion

**False sense of security:**
- Verification systems aren't foolproof
- May create overconfidence in compliance
- Need defense in depth

## Key Uncertainties

**Can monitoring work without enabling surveillance?** The same infrastructure that enables AI governance could enable authoritarian surveillance. Designing monitoring systems that provide oversight without enabling abuse is a core challenge.

**Will on-premise compute undermine cloud KYC?** If organizations respond to cloud monitoring by building their own data centers, cloud KYC becomes less effective. The trend toward on-premise compute for frontier labs is concerning for this approach.

**Is hardware governance technically feasible?** The technical challenges are substantial. Whether governance features can be added without unacceptable performance or security costs is uncertain.

**Will international coordination emerge?** Hardware governance only works if major manufacturing countries (Taiwan, South Korea, Netherlands, US) coordinate. Without coordination, governance chips create bifurcated ecosystems.

## Monitoring vs. Restriction

| Aspect | Monitoring | Restriction (Export Controls) |
|--------|------------|------------------------------|
| Goal | Visibility | Denial of access |
| Approach | Watch and verify | Block and sanction |
| Flexibility | Can respond to observed behavior | Binary allow/deny |
| Privacy impact | Higher (continuous surveillance) | Lower (one-time decision) |
| Evasion | Harder if comprehensive | Easier (smuggling, workarounds) |

**Complementary approaches:** Monitoring enables enforcement of restrictions. Export controls work better when you can verify compliance.
