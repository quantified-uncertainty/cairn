## Definition

Epistemic collapse is the **complete erosion of reliable mechanisms for establishing factual consensus**—when synthetic content overwhelms verification capacity, making truth operationally meaningless.

## Distinction from Related Risks

| Risk | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Epistemic Collapse** (this page) | *Can society determine what's true?* — Failure of truth-seeking mechanisms |
| <EntityLink id="reality-fragmentation" /> | *Do people agree on facts?* — Society splitting into incompatible realities |
| <EntityLink id="trust-erosion" /> | *Do people trust institutions?* — Declining confidence in authorities |

## Key Pathway

AI content floods channels → Verification fails → Trust erodes → Liar's dividend exploited → Epistemic tribalization → Democratic deliberation fails
