## Definition

Epistemic collapse is the **complete erosion of reliable mechanisms for establishing factual consensus**—when synthetic content overwhelms verification capacity, making truth operationally meaningless.

## Distinction from Related Risks

| Risk | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Epistemic Collapse** (this page) | *Can society determine what's true?* — Failure of truth-seeking mechanisms |
| <EntityLink id="reality-fragmentation" /> | *Do people agree on facts?* — Society splitting into incompatible realities |
| <EntityLink id="trust-erosion" /> | *Do people trust institutions?* — Declining confidence in authorities |

## Key Pathway

AI content floods channels → Verification fails → Trust erodes → Liar's dividend exploited → Epistemic tribalization → Democratic deliberation fails

## Comprehensive Coverage

**For full analysis of mechanisms, metrics, interventions, and trajectories, see <EntityLink id="epistemic-health" />.**

## AI Transition Model Context

Epistemic collapse affects <EntityLink id="civilizational-competence" />, particularly:

- <EntityLink id="epistemic-health" /> — Direct degradation of truth-seeking capacity
- <EntityLink id="reality-coherence" /> — Fragmentation into incompatible belief systems
- <EntityLink id="societal-trust" /> — Erosion of institutional credibility
