## Overview

Outcome Parameters represent what we ultimately care about when thinking about AI's impact on humanity. Unlike [leaf parameters](/knowledge-base/parameters/) (which measure specific factors) or [aggregate parameters](/knowledge-base/parameters/aggregates/) (which group related factors), outcome parameters describe the **final states** we're trying to achieve or avoid.

## The Three Outcomes

| Outcome | Question | Time Horizon |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| [**Acute Risk**](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/acute-risk/) | "What's the probability of catastrophe?" | Near to medium-term |
| [**Steady State Quality**](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/steady-state/) | "What does the world look like if we succeed?" | Long-term equilibrium |
| [**Transition Smoothness**](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/transition-smoothness/) | "How much suffering along the way?" | During transition |

## Why Three Dimensions?

These outcomes are **partially independent**—you can have different combinations:

| Scenario | Acute Risk | Steady State | Transition |
|----------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Best case | Low | Good | Smooth |
| Fast but risky | High (survived) | Good | Rough |
| Dystopia | Low | Poor | Smooth |
| Chaotic success | Medium | Good | Very rough |
| Catastrophe | Very high | N/A | N/A |

This independence means:
- **Different interventions target different outcomes**: Alignment research → Acute Risk; Economic policy → Transition; Governance design → Steady State
- **Trade-offs exist**: Some approaches that reduce acute risk might worsen transition (e.g., abrupt shutdown of AI development)
- **All three matter**: We shouldn't sacrifice one dimension entirely for another
