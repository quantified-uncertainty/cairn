## Overview

Transition Smoothness measures how well society navigates the journey from today's AI to whatever equilibrium emerges. This is about the **path**—even if we avoid [catastrophe](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/acute-risk/) and reach a good [steady state](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/steady-state/), a rough transition causes real suffering along the way.

Economic displacement, political instability, social fragmentation, and institutional failure during the transition matter independently of the final destination. The journey affects billions of lives *now*, not just hypothetical future outcomes.

## Sub-dimensions

| Dimension | Description | Key Parameters |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Economic Disruption Severity** | Job displacement, inequality spikes, market instability, supply chain failures | Economic Stability, Human Expertise |
| **Political Stability** | Democracies continue functioning; avoid authoritarian capture or collapse | Institutional Quality, Regulatory Capacity |
| **Adaptation Speed** | Institutions, individuals, and markets can keep pace with technological change | Societal Resilience, Regulatory Capacity |
| **Social Cohesion** | Trust and cooperation maintained during upheaval; communities hold together | Societal Trust, Reality Coherence |
| **Governance Capacity** | Regulators can understand and manage rapidly evolving technology | Regulatory Capacity, International Coordination |

### Primary Contributing Aggregates

| Aggregate | Relationship | Mechanism |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| [Societal Adaptability](/knowledge-base/parameters/aggregates/societal-adaptability/) | ↓↓↓ Smooths transition | Resilient, economically stable societies with preserved skills adapt better |
| [Governance Capacity](/knowledge-base/parameters/aggregates/governance-capacity/) | ↓↓ Smooths transition | Effective governance manages disruption, coordinates response, paces change |
| [Epistemic Foundation](/knowledge-base/parameters/aggregates/epistemic-foundation/) | ↓ Smooths transition | Trust and shared reality enable collective action during upheaval |

### Key Individual Parameters

| Parameter | Effect | Strength |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| [Societal Resilience](/knowledge-base/parameters/societal-resilience/) | ↓ Smooths | ↓↓↓ Critical |
| [Economic Stability](/knowledge-base/parameters/economic-stability/) | ↓ Smooths | ↓↓↓ Critical |
| [Racing Intensity](/knowledge-base/parameters/racing-intensity/) | ↑ Roughens | ↑↑ Strong (too fast = rough) |
| [Regulatory Capacity](/knowledge-base/parameters/regulatory-capacity/) | ↓ Smooths | ↓↓ Strong |
| [International Coordination](/knowledge-base/parameters/international-coordination/) | ↓ Smooths | ↓↓ Strong |
| [Societal Trust](/knowledge-base/parameters/societal-trust/) | ↓ Smooths | ↓↓ Strong |
| [Human Expertise](/knowledge-base/parameters/human-expertise/) | ↓ Smooths | ↓ Moderate |
| [Coordination Capacity](/knowledge-base/parameters/coordination-capacity/) | ↓ Smooths | ↓ Moderate |

## Why This Matters

Transition suffering is *real*, not hypothetical:
- **Immediate impact**: Disruption affects people now, not in some distant future
- **Path dependence**: Rough transitions can trigger cascading failures
- **Political backlash**: Severe disruption may produce governance failures that worsen other outcomes
- **Moral weight**: The journey matters independently; we shouldn't ignore present suffering for future gains

This outcome dimension asks: "Even if we get to a good place, how much pain along the way?"

## Relationship to Other Outcomes

| Outcome | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| [Acute Risk](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/acute-risk/) | Rough transitions can *cause* acute risk (political collapse → loss of control) |
| [Steady State](/knowledge-base/parameters/outcomes/steady-state/) | Transition path shapes what steady states are reachable (path dependence) |

A **rough transition** can:
- Trigger acute risks (political collapse, racing to deploy)
- Lock in bad steady states (authoritarian response to chaos)
- Foreclose good options (destroyed institutions, lost trust)

A **smooth transition** enables:
- Thoughtful navigation of acute risks
- Deliberate choice among steady states
- Preserved optionality

## Key Policy Levers

| Intervention | Mechanism | Primary Effect |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Economic safety nets** | Buffer job displacement, maintain demand | ↓ Economic disruption |
| **Retraining programs** | Preserve human relevance, enable adaptation | ↓ Skills obsolescence |
| **Paced deployment** | Slow down to allow adaptation | ↓ Adaptation burden |
| **International coordination** | Prevent race to bottom, share transition costs | ↓ Global disruption |
| **Institutional investment** | Strengthen regulatory capacity, democratic resilience | ↓ Political instability |
