## Overview

Epoch AI is a research organization founded in 2022 that provides rigorous, data-driven empirical analysis and forecasting of AI progress. Their work serves as critical infrastructure for [AI governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/) and [timeline forecasting](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/timelines/), tracking three key metrics: compute usage is doubling every 6 months for frontier models, high-quality training data may be exhausted by the mid-2020s, and algorithmic efficiency improves by 2x every 6-12 months.

Unlike organizations developing AI capabilities or safety techniques directly, Epoch provides the empirical foundation that informs strategic decisions across the AI ecosystem. Their databases and forecasts are cited by policymakers designing [compute governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/) frameworks, safety researchers planning research timelines, and AI labs benchmarking their progress against industry trends.

Their most influential finding is the exponential growth in training compute for frontier models—approximately 10,000x increase from 2012-2022—which has become foundational for understanding AI progress and informing governance approaches focused on compute as a key chokepoint.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Assessment | Evidence | Timeline | Trajectory |
|---------------|------------|----------|----------|------------|
| Data Bottleneck | High | High-quality text ~10^13 tokens, current usage accelerating | Mid-2020s | Worsening |
| Compute Scaling | Medium | 6-month doubling unsustainable long-term, hitting physical limits | 2030s | Stable |
| Governance Lag | High | Policy development slower than tech progress | Ongoing | Improving |
| Forecasting Accuracy | Medium | Wide uncertainty bounds, unknown unknowns | Continuous | Improving |

## Key Research Areas

### Compute Trends Analysis

Epoch's flagship research tracks computational resources used to train AI models, revealing exponential scaling patterns.

| Metric | Current Trend | Key Finding | Policy Implication |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Training Compute | 6-month doubling (2010-2022) | 10,000x increase since 2012 | [Compute governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/) viable |
| Training Costs | \$100M+ for frontier models | Projected billions by 2030 | Market concentration |
| Hardware Utilization | Massive GPU clusters | H100s bottleneck for capabilities | Export controls effectiveness |

**Critical findings from <R id="835981f69d1bf99a">Epoch's compute database</R>**:

- **Exponential growth faster than Moore's Law**: While chip performance doubles every ~2 years, AI training compute doubles every 6 months
- **Economic scaling**: Training costs reached \$100M+ for GPT-4 class models, projected to hit billions by 2030
- **Concentration effects**: Only a few actors can afford frontier training runs, creating natural bottlenecks for governance

### Training Data Constraints

Epoch's <R id="22818e0a00496c03">"Will We Run Out of Data?"</R> research revealed potential bottlenecks for continued AI scaling.

| Data Type | Estimated Stock | Current Usage Rate | Exhaustion Timeline |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| High-quality text | ~10^13 tokens | Accelerating | Mid-2020s |
| All web text | ~10^15 tokens | Increasing | Early 2030s |
| Image data | Larger but finite | Growing rapidly | 2030s+ |
| Video data | Massive but hard to use | Early stages | Unknown |

**Key implications**:
- **Pressure for efficiency**: Data constraints may force more efficient training methods
- **Synthetic data boom**: Investment in AI-generated training data accelerating
- **Multimodal shift**: [Language models](/knowledge-base/capabilities/language-models/) may pivot to image/video data

### Timeline Forecasting Methodology

Epoch employs multiple complementary approaches to estimate transformative AI timelines:

| Method | Current Estimate Range | Key Variables | Confidence Level |
|--------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Trend Extrapolation | 2030s-2040s | Compute, data, algorithms | Medium |
| Biological Anchors | 2040s-2050s | Brain computation estimates | Low |
| Benchmark Analysis | 2030s-2050s | Task performance rates | Medium |
| Economic Modeling | 2035-2060s | Investment trends, ROI | Low |

## Key Uncertainties and Debates

### Forecasting Limitations

| Uncertainty | Impact on Estimates | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Algorithmic breakthroughs | Could accelerate timelines by years | Multiple forecasting methods |
| Data efficiency improvements | May extend scaling runway | Conservative assumptions |
| Geopolitical disruption | Could fragment or accelerate development | Scenario planning |
| Hardware bottlenecks | May slow progress unexpectedly | Supply chain analysis |

### Methodological Debates

**Trend extrapolation reliability**:
- **Optimists**: Historical trends provide best available evidence for forecasting
- **Pessimists**: [Sharp left turns](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/sharp-left-turn/) and discontinuities make extrapolation unreliable
- **Epoch position**: Multiple methods with explicit uncertainty bounds

**Information hazards**:
- **Security concern**: Publishing compute data aids adversaries in capability assessment
- **Racing dynamics**: Timeline estimates may encourage competitive behavior  
- **Transparency advocates**: Public data essential for democratic governance
