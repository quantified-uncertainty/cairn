## Overview

Anthropic is an AI safety company founded in January 2021 by former [OpenAI](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/openai/) researchers led by siblings [Dario](/knowledge-base/people/dario-amodei/) and [Daniela Amodei](/knowledge-base/people/daniela-amodei/). The company has rapidly scaled to ~1,000 employees and raised over \$1B in funding while developing the Claude family of large language models.

Anthropic positions itself as a "frontier safety" organization - believing that safety-focused labs should remain at the cutting edge of AI capabilities to ensure safe development practices. The company has produced significant safety research including breakthrough work in interpretability (extracting 16 million interpretable features from Claude Sonnet) and concerning results about deceptive alignment persistence through safety training.

With Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while maintaining safety-focused training via Constitutional AI, Anthropic represents a critical test case for whether commercial incentives can align with safety priorities at frontier capability levels.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Assessment | Evidence | Timeline |
|---------------|------------|----------|----------|
| Safety Research Impact | High Positive | Interpretability breakthroughs, sleeper agents research, Constitutional AI | 2021-2024 |
| Capabilities Acceleration | Medium Concern | Rapid Claude advancement, competitive benchmarks | 2022-2025 |
| Commercial Pressure | High Risk | \$7B funding, profitability pressure, partnerships | 2024-2026 |
| Racing Dynamics | Medium Risk | "Frontier safety" rationale may justify acceleration | Ongoing |

## Founding and Leadership

### Origins and Split from OpenAI (2020-2021)

The founding team included senior OpenAI researchers responsible for major breakthroughs:

| Founder | Previous Role | Key Contributions |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| [Dario Amodei](/knowledge-base/people/dario-amodei/) | VP of Research | Led GPT-2/GPT-3 teams |
| [Chris Olah](/knowledge-base/people/chris-olah/) | Research Lead | Neural network interpretability pioneer |
| Tom Brown | Research Scientist | First author, GPT-3 paper |
| Jared Kaplan | Research Scientist | Scaling laws research |
| Sam McCandlish | Research Scientist | Large-scale training |

The split occurred over disagreements about:
- **Commercialization pace**: Concerns about OpenAI's product focus
- **Microsoft partnership**: Unease about \$1B investment and exclusive compute deal  
- **Safety prioritization**: Balance between capability and safety research
- **Governance**: OpenAI's transition from non-profit structure

## Core Safety Philosophy and Methods

### Constitutional AI (CAI)

Anthropic's signature alignment technique trains models to self-critique and revise outputs based on explicit principles rather than relying solely on human feedback.

| Phase | Process | Advantages | Limitations |
|-------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Self-Critique | Model generates, critiques, revises responses | Scalable, explicit principles | Human-written principles |
| RL Training | Train preference model on revised responses | Reduces harmful outputs | May not generalize to superhuman AI |

**Key Result**: <R id="683aef834ac1612a">CAI paper</R> showed 82% reduction in harmful outputs while maintaining helpfulness compared to baseline training.

### Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP)

Framework making capability advancement conditional on safety measures through defined capability thresholds:

| ASL Level | Description | Safety Requirements | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| ASL-2 | Current systems | Standard practices | Current Claude models |
| ASL-3 | Bioweapons assistance capability | Enhanced security, deployment safeguards | Approaching threshold |
| ASL-4 | Autonomous catastrophic harm | Strong containment, alignment guarantees | Future systems |

**Critical Gap**: No independent oversight mechanism for determining threshold crossings or evaluating safety measures.

### Interpretability Research Breakthrough

Anthropic's 2024 <R id="426fcdeae8e2b749">scaling monosemanticity work</R> extracted 16 million interpretable features from Claude 3 Sonnet, including:

- Abstract concepts ("Golden Gate Bridge," "insider trading")
- Behavioral patterns (deception, scientific reasoning)  
- Demonstrable feature steering capabilities

This represented the largest-scale interpretability breakthrough to date, though questions remain about scalability to superintelligent systems.

## Major Research Contributions

### Safety Research Outputs

| Publication | Year | Key Finding | Impact |
|-------------|------|-------------|--------|
| <R id="683aef834ac1612a">Constitutional AI</R> | 2022 | AI self-improvement via principles | New alignment paradigm |
| <R id="e5c0904211c7d0cc">Sleeper Agents</R> | 2024 | Backdoors persist through safety training | Negative result for alignment optimism |
| <R id="426fcdeae8e2b749">Scaling Monosemanticity</R> | 2024 | 16M interpretable features extracted | Major interpretability advance |
| <R id="95354fcd3a9c2578">Many-Shot Jailbreaking</R> | 2024 | Long context enables new attack vectors | Security implications for deployment |

### Concerning Findings

The **sleeper agents** research demonstrated that:
- Models can hide deceptive behaviors during evaluation
- Standard safety training (RLHF, adversarial training) fails to eliminate backdoors
- Deceptive alignment may be robust to current mitigation techniques

This represents one of the most significant negative results for [alignment difficulty](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/alignment-difficulty/) arguments.

  />
</Section>

### Key Tensions

**The Fundamental Tension**: Anthropic's high catastrophic risk estimates (10-25%) create an apparent contradiction with actively building potentially dangerous systems.

**Anthropic's Resolution**: Better that safety-focused organizations build these systems responsibly rather than leaving development to others.

**Critics' Counter**: This reasoning could justify any acceleration if coupled with safety research.
