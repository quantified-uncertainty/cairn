Safety models analyze the state of AI safety research, practices, and tradeoffs. They help understand what drives safety work and how to improve it.

## Models in This Category

- **Safety-Capability Tradeoff**: Analyzing tradeoffs between safety and capability
- **Safety Culture Equilibrium**: Dynamics of safety culture within AI labs
- **Safety Researcher Gap**: Gap between safety researcher supply and demand
- **Capabilities-to-Safety Pipeline**: How capabilities researchers transition to safety
- **Alignment Robustness Trajectory**: Trajectory of alignment robustness as capabilities scale
