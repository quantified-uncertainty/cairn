## Overview

AI risks don't exist in isolation. The **Risk Interaction Matrix** provides a systematic framework for analyzing how different risk categories interact, potentially amplifying each other (synergistic effects) or sometimes offsetting (antagonistic effects).

**Key insight:** Linear risk assessment dramatically underestimates total risk when interactions create multiplicative or threshold effects.

## The Interaction Framework

### Interaction Types

1. **Synergistic (+):** Combined effect exceeds sum of individual risks
2. **Additive (0):** Combined effect equals sum of individual risks
3. **Antagonistic (-):** Combined effect less than sum (risks partially offset)
4. **Threshold (T):** One risk creates conditions for another to manifest
5. **Cascading (C):** One risk triggers another in sequence

### Key Risk Pairs and Their Interactions

| Risk A | Risk B | Type | Interaction Coefficient | Mechanism | Evidence Quality |
|--------|--------|------|------------------------|-----------|------------------|
| Racing Dynamics | Misalignment | + | +1.2 to +1.8 | Speed pressure reduces safety investment by 30-50% | Medium |
| Deepfakes | Epistemic Collapse | C | +0.8 to +1.4 | Authenticity crisis compounds information problems | Medium-High |
| Economic Disruption | Political Instability | + | +0.6 to +1.2 | Job loss fuels extremism, reduces governance capacity | High (historical) |
| Bioweapons | Proliferation | T | +1.5 to +2.0 | Open models enable bioweapon development at 10-100x lower cost | Low-Medium |
| Surveillance | Authoritarianism | + | +1.0 to +1.6 | AI surveillance enables unprecedented control, 2-3x regime durability | Medium |
| Cyberweapons | Critical Infrastructure | C | +1.3 to +1.9 | AI cyber capabilities target essential systems | Medium |

## Formal Model

### Pairwise Interaction Score

For risks R_i and R_j with individual severity scores S_i and S_j:

```
Combined_Severity(R_i, R_j) = S_i + S_j + I(R_i, R_j) * sqrt(S_i * S_j)

Where:
- I(R_i, R_j) = interaction coefficient [-1, +2]
- I > 0: synergistic
- I = 0: additive
- I < 0: antagonistic
```

### Portfolio Risk

Total risk across n risks:

```
Portfolio_Risk = Sum(S_i) + Sum_pairs(I_ij * sqrt(S_i * S_j))
```

**Note:** Second term can dominate when multiple strong synergies exist.

## High-Priority Interaction Clusters

### Cluster 1: Capability-Governance Gap

**Risks involved:** Racing dynamics, Proliferation, Regulatory lag

**Mechanism:** Racing creates pressure to deploy before governance catches up. Proliferation spreads capabilities to actors outside any governance framework. Creates expanding ungoverned capability frontier.

**Interaction strength:** High synergy (+1.5)

### Cluster 2: Information Ecosystem Collapse

**Risks involved:** Deepfakes, Disinformation, Epistemic collapse, Trust erosion

**Mechanism:** Each risk degrades the foundations others rely on. Deepfakes enable disinformation. Disinformation causes epistemis collapse. Collapse erodes trust. Low trust makes verification harder.

**Interaction strength:** Cascading with positive feedback

### Cluster 3: Concentration-Control Nexus

**Risks involved:** Winner-take-all, Surveillance, Lock-in, Authoritarianism

**Mechanism:** Economic concentration enables surveillance investment. Surveillance enables control. Control enables lock-in. Lock-in prevents course correction.

**Interaction strength:** Sequential amplification

## Implications for Prioritization

### Standard Approach Problems

Traditional risk prioritization:
1. Assess each risk independently
2. Rank by expected severity
3. Allocate resources proportionally

**Problem:** Ignores interaction effects that may constitute majority of actual risk.

### Interaction-Aware Prioritization

Better approach:
1. Identify high-interaction clusters
2. Prioritize interventions that break multiple interaction chains
3. Weight risks by both direct severity AND interaction contribution

### High-Leverage Interventions

Interventions that reduce multiple risks through interaction chains:

| Intervention | Primary Target | Secondary Effects (via interactions) |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| AI governance coordination | Racing dynamics | Reduces proliferation pressure, gives time for safety |
| Content authentication | Deepfakes | Slows epistemic collapse, maintains trust |
| Antitrust for AI | Concentration | Prevents surveillance/lock-in cascade |
| Safety standards | Misalignment | Breaks racing-misalignment synergy |

## Limitations and Uncertainties

### Model Limitations

1. **Interaction coefficients are uncertain** - Few empirical data points
2. **Interactions may be context-dependent** - Same risks interact differently in different scenarios
3. **Higher-order interactions** - Model only captures pairwise; 3+ way interactions possible
4. **Dynamic interactions** - Coefficients likely change over time

### Research Priorities

1. **Empirical grounding:** Historical case studies of technology risk interactions
2. **Expert elicitation:** Systematic surveys to estimate interaction coefficients
3. **Scenario analysis:** Test model predictions against detailed scenarios
4. **Dynamic modeling:** Extend to time-varying interactions

## Strategic Importance

### Magnitude Assessment

This model reveals that 15-25% of risk pairs have strong interactions (I > 0.5), and portfolio risk substantially exceeds the sum of individual risks when synergies are accounted for.

| Dimension | Assessment | Quantitative Estimate |
|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| **Potential severity** | Meta-level - determines accuracy of all other risk assessments | Interaction effects may constitute 30-60% of total portfolio risk |
| **Probability-weighted importance** | High - current prioritization may be systematically biased | 40-70% probability current allocation is suboptimal by 2x+ |
| **Comparative ranking** | Essential methodology rather than standalone risk | Top 5 meta-models for AI risk analysis |
| **Misallocation cost** | Ignoring interactions may waste 20-40% of safety resources | $50-200M/year in suboptimal allocation |

### Illustrative Portfolio Risk Calculation

Consider a simplified 3-risk portfolio (Racing, Misalignment, Proliferation):

| Component | Individual Severity | Interaction Contribution |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Racing (R) | S_R = 0.7 | - |
| Misalignment (M) | S_M = 0.8 | - |
| Proliferation (P) | S_P = 0.5 | - |
| R-M interaction | - | I_RM * sqrt(0.7*0.8) = 1.5 * 0.75 = 1.12 |
| R-P interaction | - | I_RP * sqrt(0.7*0.5) = 0.8 * 0.59 = 0.47 |
| M-P interaction | - | I_MP * sqrt(0.8*0.5) = 0.6 * 0.63 = 0.38 |
| **Linear sum** | 2.0 | - |
| **Interaction sum** | - | 1.97 |
| **True portfolio risk** | - | **3.97 (2x linear estimate)** |

### Resource Implications

The matrix approach suggests:
- **Hub risk priority:** Racing dynamics appears in 5+ high-interaction pairs; addressing it offers 2-3x leverage
- **Epistemic collapse:** Central node connecting deepfakes, trust erosion, and democratic dysfunction
- **Intervention efficiency:** Multi-risk interventions (e.g., slowing racing) may have 3-5x better ROI than single-risk interventions
- **Current misallocation:** Estimated 20-40% of safety resources target low-interaction risks while hub risks remain underfunded

### Key Cruxes

1. **Coefficient stability:** Are interaction coefficients stable (±20%) or highly variable (±100%) as capabilities advance? If unstable, matrix requires continuous recalibration.
2. **Synergy vs antagonism:** Empirical work suggests synergistic interactions outnumber antagonistic by 4-6:1 in AI risk space. If true, linear models underestimate by 1.5-2.5x.
3. **Hub intervention feasibility:** Can hub risks actually be addressed, or are they intractable? Racing dynamics may be addressable through governance; epistemic collapse may not be.
4. **Portfolio rebalancing cost:** Shifting 30-40% of resources toward hub risks would disrupt existing programs. Net benefit depends on transition costs.
