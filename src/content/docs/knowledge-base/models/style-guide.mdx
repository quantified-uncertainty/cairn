import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide covers both **format requirements** and **methodological considerations** for analytical models in this knowledge base.

---

## Part 1: Format Requirements

### Overview Section

Write 2-3 paragraphs of **flowing prose** (no bullet points). The overview should explain the model's central insight, describe why understanding this matters, and preview the key findings or framework structure.

### Visual Diagrams

Include at least one **Mermaid diagram** showing conceptual structure. Use the component syntax:

```jsx
<Mermaid client:load chart={`
flowchart TD
    A[Factor A] --> B[Factor B]
    B --> C[Outcome]
`} />
```

Consider flowcharts for processes, network diagrams for relationships. Add a brief caption explaining what the diagram shows.

### Quantitative Tables

Include tables with **3+ columns and 4+ rows**. Tables should add information beyond what prose conveys. Include uncertainty ranges where appropriate (low/central/high estimates).

### Scenario Analysis

Include probability-weighted scenarios (typically 3-5). Each scenario should have: probability, key characteristics, and implications. Calculate expected values where meaningful.

### Limitations Section

Write in **flowing prose** (not bullets). Be specific about what the model cannot do. Explain what would change the conclusions.

## Part 2: Methodological Considerations

### Avoid False Binary Thresholds

<Aside type="caution" title="Common Problem">
Models often imply sharp cutoffs ("if X > 80%, collapse occurs") when reality involves continuous degradation.
</Aside>

**Bad example:**

| Status | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| Safe | < 50% |
| Danger | 50-80% |
| COLLAPSED | > 80% |

**Better approach:**
- Use gradient language: "largely past," "degrading," "limited risk"
- Acknowledge that most systems degrade continuously
- If using threshold framing, add explicit caveats:

> "This threshold is illustrative, not predictive. Real systems degrade continuously rather than exhibiting discrete phase transitions."

### Avoid Naive Multiplicative Formulas

<Aside type="caution" title="Common Problem">
Formulas like `P(cascade) = P(A) × P(B) × P(C) × P(D)` assume independence when factors are often correlated.
</Aside>

**Bad example:**
```
P(disaster) = P(trigger) × P(vulnerability) × P(amplification) × P(failure)
```
This treats each factor as an independent dice roll.

**Better approach:**

1. **Acknowledge correlations explicitly:**

| Factor | Correlated With |
|--------|-----------------|
| Institutional failure | Amplification (+), Detection (-) |
| Vulnerability | Amplification (+) |

2. **Use influence diagrams** instead of formulas—show which factors influence which, include strength and direction of influence.

3. **If using formulas, add caveats:**

> "This formula assumes independence, but factors are likely correlated. If institutions that fail to detect also fail to respond, true risk is higher than naive multiplication suggests."

### Prefer Influence Thinking Over Formula Thinking

| Approach | Characteristics | When to Use |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Formula thinking** ("X = A × B × C") | Implies precise calculation; obscures uncertainty and correlations | When you have empirical calibration; when independence is reasonable; when illustrating a conceptual point (with caveats) |
| **Influence thinking** ("A influences B, which affects C") | Shows causal structure; makes correlations visible; acknowledges continuous relationships | When factors are causally connected; when correlations are significant; when the relationship structure is the main insight |

### Use the CauseEffectGraph Component

For complex causal relationships, consider using the interactive CauseEffectGraph component. See [the demo page](/guides/cause-effect-demo/) for a working example.

```jsx
<CauseEffectGraph
  client:load
  height={500}
  initialNodes={[
    {
      id: '1',
      type: 'causeEffect',
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      data: {
        label: 'Factor A',
        description: 'Brief description',
        type: 'cause',  // 'cause', 'intermediate', or 'effect'
        confidence: 0.7,
        details: 'Extended explanation...',
        sources: ['Source 1', 'Source 2'],
        relatedConcepts: ['Concept 1', 'Concept 2']
      }
    }
  ]}
  initialEdges={[
    {
      id: 'e1-2',
      source: '1',
      target: '2',
      data: {
        strength: 'strong',     // 'strong', 'medium', 'weak'
        confidence: 'high',     // 'high', 'medium', 'low'
        effect: 'increases'     // 'increases' or 'decreases'
      }
    }
  ]}
/>
```

## Checklist for Model Review

### Format
- [ ] Overview is 2-3 paragraphs of flowing prose (no bullets)
- [ ] At least one Mermaid diagram included
- [ ] Quantitative tables with 3+ columns
- [ ] Scenario analysis with probability weights
- [ ] Limitations in prose format

### Methodology
- [ ] No false binary thresholds (or caveated if present)
- [ ] Multiplicative formulas acknowledge correlations
- [ ] Influence relationships shown where appropriate
- [ ] Uncertainty ranges included
- [ ] Caveats are specific and actionable

### Common Issues to Fix

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "EXCEEDED / NOT YET" | Use "largely past / degrading / limited" |
| "If X > threshold, collapse" | "As X increases, effects intensify" |
| "P = A × B × C" without caveat | Add correlation acknowledgment |
| Sharp phase transitions | Acknowledge continuous degradation |
