## Overview

Analytical models provide structured frameworks for thinking about AI risks. Each model offers a different lens—probability decomposition, comparative analysis, or timeline projection—for understanding specific risk scenarios.

Models are meant to be exploratory and illustrative rather than definitive. They help identify key uncertainties, structure thinking, and enable comparison of different assumptions.

## Using These Models

Models are designed to:
- **Structure thinking** about complex, uncertain scenarios
- **Identify cruxes** where disagreement is concentrated
- **Enable sensitivity analysis** on key assumptions
- **Communicate** risk reasoning to others

They are not designed to provide precise probability estimates—the underlying uncertainties are too large for that.

## Contributing

Models should include:
1. Clear statement of what's being modeled
2. Key assumptions and their justification
3. Decomposition or analysis structure
4. Estimates with uncertainty ranges
5. Sensitivity to key parameters
6. Limitations and caveats
