Timeline models project when specific risks might emerge and when intervention windows might close. They help with planning and resource allocation by identifying critical periods.

## Models in This Category

- **Bioweapons Timeline**: Projections for when AI might enable bioweapons development
- **Authentication Collapse Timeline**: When deepfakes might undermine content authentication
- **Risk Activation Timeline**: Sequencing of when various AI risks become acute
- **Intervention Timing Windows**: Windows for effective intervention before risks materialize
