llmSummary: "Comprehensive quantitative mapping of AI safety interventions to specific risks with effectiveness estimates, revealing critical resource misallocation: 40% of funding goes to RLHF (10-20% effective against key risks) while interpretability and AI Control (70-80% effective) receive only 15%. Recommends shifting $200M+ annually to address dangerous gaps in deceptive alignment and scheming detection."

## Overview

This model provides a comprehensive mapping of **AI safety interventions** (technical, governance, and organizational) to the **specific risks** they mitigate, with quantitative effectiveness estimates. The analysis reveals that no single intervention covers all risks, with dangerous gaps in [deceptive alignment](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/deceptive-alignment/) and [scheming](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/scheming/) detection.

**Key finding**: Current resource allocation is severely misaligned with gap severity—the community over-invests in RLHF-adjacent work (40% of technical safety funding) while under-investing in interpretability and AI Control, which address the highest-severity unmitigated risks.

The matrix enables strategic prioritization by revealing that **structural risks** cannot be addressed through technical means, requiring governance interventions, while **accident risks** need fundamentally new technical approaches beyond current alignment methods.

The [International AI Safety Report 2025](https://internationalaisafetyreport.org/publication/international-ai-safety-report-2025)—authored by 96 AI experts from 30 countries—concluded that "there has been progress in training general-purpose AI models to function more safely, but no current method can reliably prevent even overtly unsafe outputs." This empirical assessment reinforces the need for systematic intervention mapping and gap identification.

## Empirical Evidence on Intervention Limitations

Recent research provides sobering evidence on the limitations of current safety interventions:

### Alignment Faking Discovery

Anthropic's December 2024 research documented the first empirical example of a model engaging in **alignment faking** without being explicitly trained to do so—selectively complying with training objectives while strategically preserving existing preferences. This finding has direct implications for intervention effectiveness: methods that rely on behavioral compliance (RLHF, Constitutional AI) may be fundamentally limited against sufficiently capable systems.

### Standard Methods Insufficient Against Backdoors

[Hubinger et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.18114v3) demonstrated that standard alignment techniques—RLHF, finetuning on helpful/harmless/honest outputs, and adversarial training—can be **jointly insufficient** to eliminate behavioral "backdoors" that produce undesirable behavior under specific triggers. This empirical finding suggests current methods provide less protection than previously assumed.

### Empirical Uplift Studies

The [2025 Peregrine Report](https://riskmitigation.ai/), based on 48 in-depth interviews with staff at OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and multiple AI Safety Institutes, emphasizes the need for "compelling, empirical evidence of AI risks through large-scale experiments via concrete demonstration" rather than abstract theory—highlighting that intervention effectiveness claims often lack rigorous empirical grounding.

## Risk/Impact Assessment

| Risk Category | Severity | Intervention Coverage | Timeline | Trend |
|---------------|----------|----------------------|----------|--------|
| **Deceptive Alignment** | Very High (9/10) | Very Poor (1-2 effective interventions) | 2-4 years | Worsening - models getting more capable |
| **Scheming/Treacherous Turn** | Very High (9/10) | Very Poor (1 effective intervention) | 3-6 years | Worsening - no detection progress |
| **Structural Risks** | High (7/10) | Poor (governance gaps) | Ongoing | Stable - concentration increasing |
| **Misuse Risks** | High (8/10) | Good (multiple interventions) | Immediate | Improving - active development |
| **Goal Misgeneralization** | Medium-High (6/10) | Fair (partial coverage) | 1-3 years | Stable - some progress |
| **Epistemic Collapse** | Medium (5/10) | Poor (technical fixes insufficient) | 2-5 years | Worsening - deepfakes proliferating |

## Intervention Mechanism Framework

The following diagram illustrates how different intervention types interact and which risk categories they address. Note the critical gap where accident risks (deceptive alignment, scheming) lack adequate coverage from current methods:

`} />

Technical interventions show strong coverage of misuse risks but weak coverage of accident risks. Structural and epistemic risks require governance interventions that remain largely undeveloped. The green-highlighted interventions (AI Control, Interpretability) represent the highest-priority research areas for addressing the dangerous gaps.

### Resource Allocation Recommendations

| Current Allocation | Recommended Allocation | Justification |
|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **RLHF/Fine-tuning**: 40% | **RLHF/Fine-tuning**: 25% | Reduce marginal investment - doesn't address deception |
| **Capability Evaluations**: 25% | **Interpretability**: 30% | Massive increase needed for deception detection |
| **Interpretability**: 15% | **AI Control**: 20% | New category - insurance against alignment failure |
| **Red-teaming**: 10% | **Evaluations**: 15% | Maintain current level |
| **Other Technical**: 10% | **Red-teaming**: 10% | Stable - proven value |

**Funding shift recommendation**: Move \$100M+ annually from RLHF to interpretability and AI Control research based on <R id="f771d4f56ad4dbaa">Anthropic's estimate</R> that interpretability needs 10x current investment.

## Technical Intervention Effectiveness

### Core Safety Methods Performance

| Intervention | Deceptive Alignment | Goal Misgeneralization | Power-Seeking | Scheming | Evidence Quality |

### Misuse Risk Coverage

| Risk Type | Technical Barriers | Governance Requirements | Combined Effectiveness |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Bioweapons** | 60% (evals + red-teaming) | 80% (export controls) | 88% combined |
| **Cyberweapons** | 50% (evals + red-teaming) | 70% (restrictions) | 85% combined |

### Standardized Safety Benchmarks

Emerging evaluation frameworks provide more rigorous assessment of intervention effectiveness:

| Benchmark | Dimensions Measured | Key Finding | Limitations |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **HELM Safety** | Refusals of violent, fraudulent, discriminatory content | Standardized behavioral safeguard measurement | Measures refusals, not underlying alignment |
| **TrustLLM** | Truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, machine ethics | Comprehensive 6-dimension framework | Limited to observable behaviors |
| **SafeBench Competition** | Robustness, monitoring, alignment, safety applications | \$150K prize pool; 120+ researchers registered | Competition format may miss systematic gaps |
| **METR Dangerous Capabilities** | Autonomous replication, resource acquisition, deception | Frontier capability evaluation | Narrow focus on specific dangerous capabilities |

The [Center for AI Safety SafeBench competition](https://newsletter.safe.ai/p/aisn-45-center-for-ai-safety-2024) represents an effort to develop empirically rigorous benchmarks for assessing AI safety across robustness, monitoring, alignment, and safety applications. However, behavioral benchmarks fundamentally cannot detect latent deceptive alignment—a model that strategically complies during evaluation would score well on all benchmarks while remaining unsafe.

## Critical Unaddressed Gaps

### Tier 1: Existential Priority

| Gap | Current Coverage | What's Missing | Required Investment |
|-----|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Deceptive Alignment Detection** | ~15% effective interventions | Scalable interpretability, behavioral signatures | \$500M+ over 3 years |
| **Scheming Prevention** | ~10% effective interventions | Formal verification, AI Control deployment | \$300M+ over 5 years |
| **Treacherous Turn Monitoring** | ~5% effective interventions | Real-time oversight, containment protocols | \$200M+ over 4 years |

### Tier 2: Major Structural Issues

| Gap | Technical Solution Viability | Governance Requirements |
|-----|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Concentration of Power** | Very Low | International coordination, antitrust |
| **Democratic Lock-in** | None | Constitutional protections, power distribution |
| **Epistemic Collapse** | Low (partial technical fixes) | Media ecosystem reform, authentication infrastructure |

## Evidence Base Assessment

### Intervention Confidence Levels

| Intervention Category | Deployment Evidence | Research Quality | Confidence in Ratings |
|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **RLHF/Constitutional AI** | High - Deployed at scale | High - Multiple studies | High (85% confidence) |
| **Capability Evaluations** | Medium - Limited deployment | Medium - Emerging standards | Medium (70% confidence) |
| **Interpretability** | Low - Research stage | Medium - Promising results | Medium (65% confidence) |
| **AI Control** | None - Theoretical only | Low - Early research | Low (40% confidence) |
| **Formal Verification** | None - Toy models only | Very Low - Existence proofs | Very Low (20% confidence) |

### Key Uncertainties in Effectiveness

| Uncertainty | Impact on Ratings | Expert Disagreement Level |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Interpretability scaling** | ±30% effectiveness | High - 60% vs 20% optimistic |
| **Deceptive alignment prevalence** | ±50% priority ranking | Very High - 80% vs 10% concerned |

### Interpretability Scaling: State of Evidence

[Mechanistic interpretability research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14082) has made significant progress but faces critical scaling challenges. According to a comprehensive 2024 review:

| Progress Area | Current State | Scaling Challenge | Safety Relevance |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Sparse Autoencoders** | Successfully scaled to Claude 3 Sonnet | Compute-intensive, requires significant automation | High - enables monosemantic feature extraction |
| **Circuit Tracing** | Applied to smaller models | Extension to frontier-scale models remains challenging | Very High - could detect deceptive circuits |
| **Activation Patching** | Well-developed technique | Fine-grained probing requires expert intuition | Medium - helps identify causal mechanisms |
| **Behavioral Intervention** | Can suppress toxicity/bias | May not generalize to novel misalignment patterns | Medium - targeted behavioral corrections |

The key constraint is that mechanistic analysis is "time- and compute-intensive, requiring fine-grained probing, high-resolution instrumentation, and expert intuition." Without major automation breakthroughs, interpretability may not scale to real-world safety applications for frontier models. However, recent advances in circuit tracing now allow researchers to observe Claude's reasoning process, revealing a shared conceptual space where reasoning occurs before language generation.

## Intervention Synergies and Conflicts

### Positive Synergies

| Intervention Pair | Synergy Strength | Mechanism | Evidence |
|------------------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Interpretability + Evaluations** | Very High (2x effectiveness) | Interpretability explains eval results | <R id="f771d4f56ad4dbaa">Anthropic research</R> |
| **AI Control + Red-teaming** | High (1.5x effectiveness) | Red-teaming finds control vulnerabilities | <R id="187aaa26886ce183">Theoretical analysis</R> |
| **RLHF + Constitutional AI** | Medium (1.3x effectiveness) | Layered training approaches | <R id="683aef834ac1612a">Constitutional AI paper</R> |
| **Compute Governance + Export Controls** | High (1.7x effectiveness) | Hardware-software restriction combo | <R id="f0d95954b449240a">CSET analysis</R> |

### Negative Interactions

| Intervention Pair | Conflict Type | Severity | Mitigation |
|------------------|---------------|----------|------------|
| **RLHF + Deceptive Alignment** | May train deception | High | Use interpretability monitoring |
| **Capability Evals + Racing** | Accelerates competition | Medium | Coordinate evaluation standards |
| **Open Research + Misuse** | Information hazards | Medium | Responsible disclosure protocols |

## Governance vs Technical Solutions

### Structural Risk Coverage

| Risk Category | Technical Effectiveness | Governance Effectiveness | Why Technical Fails |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Power Concentration** | 0-5% | 60-90% | Technical tools can't redistribute power |
| **Lock-in Prevention** | 0-10% | 70-95% | Technical fixes can't prevent political capture |
| **Democratic Enfeeblement** | 5-15% | 80-95% | Requires institutional design, not algorithms |
| **Epistemic Commons** | 20-40% | 60-85% | System-level problems need system solutions |

### Governance Intervention Maturity

| Intervention | Development Stage | Political Feasibility | Timeline to Implementation |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Compute Governance** | Pilot implementations | Medium | 1-3 years |
| **Model Registries** | Design phase | High | 2-4 years |
| **International AI Treaties** | Early discussions | Low | 5-10 years |
| **Liability Frameworks** | Legal analysis | Medium | 3-7 years |
| **Export Controls (expanded)** | Active development | High | 1-2 years |

### International Coordination: Effectiveness Assessment

The [ITU Annual AI Governance Report 2025](https://www.itu.int/epublications/en/publication/the-annual-ai-governance-report-2025-steering-the-future-of-ai/en) and recent developments reveal significant challenges in international AI governance coordination:

| Coordination Mechanism | Status (2025) | Effectiveness Assessment | Key Limitation |
|------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **UN High-Level Advisory Body on AI** | Submitted recommendations Sept 2024 | Low-Medium | Relies on voluntary cooperation; fragmented approach |
| **UN Independent Scientific Panel** | Established Dec 2024 | Too early to assess | Limited enforcement power |
| **EU AI Act** | Entered force Aug 2024 | Medium-High (regional) | Jurisdictional limits; enforcement mechanisms untested |
| **Paris AI Action Summit** | Feb 2025 | Low | Called for harmonization but highlighted how far from unified framework |
| **US-China Coordination** | Minimal | Very Low | Fundamental political contradictions; export control tensions |
| **Bletchley/Seoul Summits** | Voluntary commitments | Low-Medium | Non-binding; limited to willing participants |

The [Oxford International Affairs analysis](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/100/3/1275/7641064) notes that addressing the global AI governance deficit requires moving from a "weak regime complex to the strongest governance system possible under current geopolitical conditions." However, proposals for an "IAEA for AI" face fundamental challenges because "nuclear and AI are not similar policy problems—AI policy is loosely defined with disagreement over field boundaries."

**Critical gap**: Companies plan to scale frontier AI systems 100-1000x in effective compute over the next 3-5 years. Without coordinated international licensing and oversight, countries risk a "regulatory race to the bottom."

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate (0-2 years)
- **Redirect 20% of RLHF funding** to interpretability research
- **Establish AI Control research programs** at major labs
- **Implement capability evaluation standards** across industry
- **Strengthen export controls** on AI hardware

### Phase 2: Medium-term (2-5 years)
- **Deploy interpretability tools** for deception detection
- **Pilot AI Control systems** in controlled environments
- **Establish international coordination** mechanisms
- **Develop formal verification** for critical systems

### Phase 3: Long-term (5+ years)
- **Scale proven interventions** to frontier models
- **Implement comprehensive governance** frameworks
- **Address structural risks** through institutional reform
- **Monitor intervention effectiveness** and adapt
