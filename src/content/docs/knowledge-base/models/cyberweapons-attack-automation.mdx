## Overview

This model projects when AI systems will be capable of conducting complete cyber attack campaigns with minimal or no human involvement. We define "autonomous cyber attack" as an AI system that can:

1. Identify targets and vulnerabilities
2. Develop or adapt exploits
3. Execute attacks
4. Adapt to defenses in real-time
5. Achieve attacker-specified objectives
6. Operate persistently over extended campaigns

**Key Question:** When does AI cross the threshold from "assistant" to "autonomous attacker"?

## The Autonomy Spectrum

Cyber attacks exist on a spectrum from fully human-directed to fully autonomous:

### Level 0: Human-Driven (Traditional)
- Humans perform all stages
- Tools assist but don't make decisions
- **Timeline:** Pre-2020 baseline

### Level 1: AI-Assisted (Current)
- AI suggests vulnerabilities or exploits
- Humans select targets and make key decisions
- AI accelerates specific tasks
- **Timeline:** 2020-2024 (current state)

### Level 2: AI-Supervised
- AI conducts reconnaissance and initial exploitation
- Humans approve major actions
- AI operates within defined parameters
- **Timeline:** 2024-2026 (emerging)

### Level 3: Semi-Autonomous
- AI conducts full attack chains
- Humans set high-level objectives
- AI adapts tactics without approval
- **Timeline:** 2025-2027 (early examples exist)

### Level 4: Fully Autonomous
- AI identifies targets based on strategic goals
- End-to-end attack execution
- Long-term persistent presence
- Self-improving capabilities
- **Timeline:** 2027-2030 (projected)

### Level 5: Superintelligent Cyber Operations
- AI discovers novel vulnerability classes
- Creates fundamentally new attack methods
- Operates at scale across global infrastructure
- Potentially undefendable by human-level defenders
- **Timeline:** Unknown, possibly never

## Current State Assessment (2025)

### Documented Capabilities

**September 2025: First Autonomous Campaign**
Anthropic documented what they assessed as the first large-scale AI-orchestrated cyberattack with minimal human intervention:
- ~30 targets (tech companies, financial institutions, governments)
- Chinese state-sponsored attribution
- "Agentic" AI capabilities executing attack chains
- Milestone: **Level 3** achieved

**Academic Demonstrations**
Multiple research teams have demonstrated AI systems that can:
- Discover and exploit vulnerabilities in controlled environments
- Navigate network defenses autonomously
- Adapt to countermeasures in real-time
- Maintain persistence without human guidance

**Commercial Offensive Tools**
Security testing tools incorporating increasingly autonomous features:
- Automated penetration testing (Pentera, Cymulate)
- Vulnerability exploitation frameworks with AI
- Attack simulation systems

**Current Assessment:** We are at **Level 2-3** transition. Semi-autonomous attacks are emerging but not yet widespread.

## Capability Requirements Analysis

For true Level 4 autonomy, AI systems need:

### 1. Reconnaissance & Target Selection
**Current Status:** High capability (80% autonomous)
- AI can scan networks, enumerate services, identify valuable targets

## Critical Bottlenecks

What could delay full autonomy?

### Technical Bottlenecks

**1. Strategic Understanding**
AI still struggles with complex, context-dependent strategic decisions. Knowing *what* to attack and *why* requires nuance current systems lack.

**Estimated Impact:** Could delay Level 4 by 2-3 years

**2. Adaptive Defense**
If defensive AI advances as fast as offensive, autonomous attacks may be contained before completing objectives.

**Estimated Impact:** May cap success rates rather than prevent capability

**3. Long-Term Persistence**
Maintaining undetected presence over months is highly sophisticated. Current AI has limited ability to "think" long-term.

**Estimated Impact:** Could delay Level 4 by 1-2 years

### Regulatory Bottlenecks

**1. International Agreements**
If major powers agree to limit autonomous cyber weapons, development could slow.

**Estimated Impact:** Could delay by 2-4 years if comprehensive

**Likelihood:** Low (as of 2025, no serious proposals)

**2. Dual-Use Restrictions**
Many offensive AI capabilities are dual-use (security testing). Hard to restrict without harming defense.

**Estimated Impact:** Minimal

**3. Corporate Self-Regulation**
AI labs might refuse to develop offensive capabilities.

**Estimated Impact:** Minimal (state programs would continue)

## Indicators to Watch

How will we know when Level 4 is approaching?

### Technical Indicators
- Academic papers demonstrating autonomous attack completion

**Medium Risk:**
- Some defensive preparation possible
- Window for international norms
- Managed transition feasible

**Recommended Actions:**
- Accelerate defensive AI deployment
- Establish attribution mechanisms
- Develop offensive/defensive AI treaties
- Build resilient infrastructure

### If Level 4 Delayed Beyond 2030 (Conservative Scenario)

**Lower Risk:**
- Defense keeps pace
- Regulatory frameworks mature
- Norms established before widespread deployment

**Recommended Actions:**
- Maintain defensive AI investment
- Use time window for international agreements
- Develop robust attribution and deterrence

## Model Limitations

1. **Assumes Continuous Progress:** AI development could plateau or face unexpected barriers

2. **Linear Extrapolation Risk:** Capabilities might advance in jumps rather than smoothly

3. **Ignores Wild Cards:** Quantum computing, novel AI architectures could accelerate or change trajectory

4. **State vs. Criminal Actors:** Model primarily considers state-level capabilities; criminal diffusion may differ

5. **Defense Co-Evolution:** Defensive capabilities are modeled separately but deeply affect offensive success

## Strategic Importance

### Magnitude Assessment

Autonomous cyber attacks represent a near-term AI risk with high probability of occurrence but variable severity depending on targets.

| Dimension | Assessment | Quantitative Estimate |
|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| **Potential severity** | High (critical infrastructure targeting) to Moderate (corporate espionage) | $100B-10T potential damage per year at Level 4 |
| **Probability-weighted importance** | High priority - Level 3 already emerging | 90% probability of Level 3 widespread by 2027 |
| **Comparative ranking** | Top-tier near-term risk; lower-tier for existential | #1-2 near-term AI risk; #5-10 for existential |
| **Time to critical threshold** | Short - faster than most AI risks | 2-4 years to Level 4 (moderate scenario) |

### Economic Impact Projections

| Autonomy Level | Annual Cyber Losses (Current) | Projected with AI | Multiplier | Timeline |
|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| Level 2 | $500B | $700B | 1.4x | 2024-2025 |
| Level 3 | $500B | $1.5-2T | 3-4x | 2026-2027 |
| Level 4 | $500B | $3-5T | 6-10x | 2028-2030 |
| Level 5 | $500B | $10T+ (if achieved) | 20x+ | Unknown |

### Defense Investment Gap

| Category | Current Annual Investment | Required for Parity | Gap |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------------|-----|
| Offensive AI cyber (est.) | $10-20B globally | N/A | N/A |
| Defensive AI cyber | $2-5B | $15-25B | 3-10x underfunded |
| Attribution systems | $500M | $2-3B | 4-6x underfunded |
| Critical infrastructure hardening | $20B | $50-100B | 2.5-5x underfunded |

### Resource Implications

The 2-5 year timeline to Level 4 autonomy provides a window for:
- Defensive AI development: **$15-25B/year needed** (estimated 10-15% of offensive investment currently; parity requires 100%)
- Critical infrastructure hardening: **$50-100B total** over 5 years
- International norms development: **$100-200M/year** for diplomatic track
- Attribution capability improvements: **$2-3B/year** to maintain deterrence

**Key Insight:** Current defensive investment is 3-10x below what is needed for Level 4 resilience.

### Key Cruxes

| Crux | If True | If False | Current Probability |
|------|---------|----------|---------------------|
| Defensive AI keeps pace | Manageable escalation | Offense dominance, massive losses | 35% |
| Full autonomy offers meaningful advantage | Rapid proliferation pressure | Semi-autonomous remains sufficient | 70% |
| Proliferation to non-state actors is slow | Window for governance | Terrorism/crime escalation | 40% |
| Attribution adapts to AI attacks | Deterrence maintained | Escalation spirals, anonymous attacks | 45% |

## Key Debates

**Is Full Autonomy Even Desirable?** Even if technically feasible, will actors deploy fully autonomous attacks given risk of unintended escalation?

**Can Humans Meaningfully Remain in the Loop?** If attacks operate at machine speed, human oversight may be illusory.

**Will Defense Autonomy Match Offense?** Autonomous attacks may force autonomous defense, creating escalatory dynamics.
