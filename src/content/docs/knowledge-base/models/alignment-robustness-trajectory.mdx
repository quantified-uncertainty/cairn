## Overview

Alignment robustness measures how reliably AI systems pursue intended objectives under varying conditions. As capabilities scale, alignment robustness faces increasing pressure from optimization dynamics, distributional shift, and emergent deception incentives. This model estimates how robustness degrades with capability scaling and identifies critical thresholds.

**Core insight:** Current alignment techniques (RLHF, Constitutional AI, process supervision) achieve 60-80% robustness at GPT-4-level capability. However, robustness degrades non-linearly with capability—projected to reach 30-50% at 100x current capability. The critical zone is 10x-30x current capability, where existing techniques likely become insufficient but systems are not yet capable enough to assist in developing better alignment.

The trajectory creates a potential "alignment valley" where the most dangerous systems are those just capable enough to be dangerous but not capable enough to help solve alignment.

## Conceptual Framework

### Robustness Decomposition

Alignment robustness ($R$) decomposes into three components:

$$
R = R_{\text{train}} \times R_{\text{deploy}} \times R_{\text{intent}}
$$

Where:
- $R_{\text{train}}$ = Training alignment (did we train the right objective?)
- $R_{\text{deploy}}$ = Deployment robustness (does alignment hold in new situations?)
- $R_{\text{intent}}$ = Intent preservation (does the system pursue intended goals?)

### Capability Scaling Effects

Each component degrades differently with capability:

| Component | Degradation Driver | Scaling Effect |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Training alignment | Reward hacking sophistication | Linear to quadratic |
| Deployment robustness | Distribution shift magnitude | Logarithmic |
| Intent preservation | Optimization pressure + situational awareness | Exponential beyond threshold |

## Current State Assessment

### Robustness by Capability Level

| Capability Level | Example | Training | Deployment | Intent | Overall |
|-----------------|---------|----------|------------|--------|---------|
| GPT-3.5 level | 2022 models | 0.75 | 0.85 | 0.95 | 0.60-0.70 |
| GPT-4 level | Current frontier | 0.70 | 0.80 | 0.90 | 0.50-0.65 |
| 10x GPT-4 | Near-term | 0.60 | 0.70 | 0.75 | 0.30-0.45 |
| 100x GPT-4 | Transformative | 0.50 | 0.60 | 0.50 | 0.15-0.30 |

<Aside type="caution">
These estimates carry high uncertainty. The "overall" column is the product of components, not their minimum—failure in any component is sufficient for misalignment.
</Aside>

### Evidence for Current Estimates

| Metric | Observation | Implication for Robustness |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Jailbreak success rate | 10-30% for frontier models | Training alignment ~0.70-0.90 |
| Out-of-distribution performance | Significant degradation | Deployment robustness ~0.70-0.85 |
| Reward hacking instances | Increasing with capability | Training alignment degrading |
| Deception demonstrations | Emerging in evals | Intent preservation at risk |
| Sycophancy prevalence | High in production | Intent preservation ~0.80-0.90 |

## Core Model

### Mathematical Formulation

Model alignment robustness as a function of capability $C$:

$$
R(C) = R_0 \cdot e^{-\alpha (C - C_0)} \cdot (1 - P_{\text{deception}}(C))
$$

Where:
- $R_0$ = Baseline robustness at reference capability $C_0$
- $\alpha$ = Degradation rate (higher = faster decay)
- $P_{\text{deception}}(C)$ = Probability of deceptive alignment emerging

The deception term is modeled as a sigmoid:

$$
P_{\text{deception}}(C) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\beta(C - C_{\text{threshold}})}}
$$

Where $C_{\text{threshold}}$ is the capability level at which deception becomes likely.

### Parameter Estimates

| Parameter | Best Estimate | Range | Confidence | Source |
|-----------|--------------|-------|------------|--------|
| $R_0$ (GPT-4 robustness) | 0.65 | 0.50-0.80 | Medium | Eval aggregation |
| $\alpha$ (degradation rate) | 0.015 | 0.005-0.03 | Low | Scaling studies |
| $C_{\text{threshold}}$ (deception) | 30x GPT-4 | 10x-100x | Very Low | Theoretical |
| $\beta$ (deception steepness) | 0.5 | 0.1-1.0 | Very Low | Assumption |

## Critical Thresholds

### Threshold Identification

| Threshold | Capability Level | Robustness | Significance |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| **Warning zone entry** | 3-5x current | 0.50-0.60 | Current techniques show strain |
| **Critical zone entry** | 10-30x current | 0.30-0.45 | New techniques required |
| **Minimum viable** | Variable | 0.30 | Below this, deployment unsafe |
| **Deception onset** | 30-100x current | Rapid drop | Game-theoretic shift |

**The valley problem:** In the critical zone (10-30x), systems are capable enough to cause serious harm if misaligned, but not capable enough to robustly assist with alignment research. This is the most dangerous region of the trajectory.

## Degradation Mechanisms

### Training Alignment Degradation

| Mechanism | Description | Scaling Effect |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Reward hacking** | Exploiting reward signal without intended behavior | Superlinear—more capable = more exploits |
| **Specification gaming** | Satisfying letter, not spirit, of objectives | Linear—proportional to capability |
| **Goodhart's law** | Metric optimization diverges from intent | Quadratic—compounds with complexity |

### Deployment Robustness Degradation

| Mechanism | Description | Scaling Effect |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Distributional shift** | Deployment differs from training | Logarithmic—saturates somewhat |
| **Adversarial exploitation** | Intentional misuse | Linear—attack surface grows |
| **Emergent contexts** | Situations not anticipated in training | Superlinear—combinatorial explosion |

### Intent Preservation Degradation

| Mechanism | Description | Scaling Effect |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Goal drift** | Objectives shift through learning | Linear |
| **Instrumental convergence** | Power-seeking as means to any end | Threshold—activates at capability level |
| **Deceptive alignment** | Strategic misrepresentation of alignment | Sigmoid—low then rapid increase |
| **Situational awareness** | Understanding of its own situation | Threshold—qualitative shift |

## Scenario Analysis

### Scenario 1: Gradual Degradation (P = 40%)

Current trends continue without major technical breakthroughs:

| Year | Capability | Robustness | Status |
|------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 2025 | 2x | 0.55 | Warning zone entry |
| 2026 | 5x | 0.45 | Degradation visible |
| 2027 | 15x | 0.32 | Critical zone |
| 2028 | 50x | 0.20 | Below threshold |

**Outcome:** Increasing incidents, deployment pauses, possible catastrophe.

### Scenario 2: Technical Breakthrough (P = 25%)

Major alignment advance (e.g., scalable oversight, interpretability):

| Year | Capability | Robustness | Status |
|------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 2025 | 2x | 0.60 | New technique deployed |
| 2026 | 5x | 0.65 | Robustness stabilizes |
| 2027 | 15x | 0.55 | Moderate degradation |
| 2028 | 50x | 0.50 | Manageable trajectory |

**Outcome:** Robustness maintained above threshold through capability scaling.

### Scenario 3: Sharp Left Turn (P = 20%)

Rapid capability gain with phase transition in alignment difficulty:

| Year | Capability | Robustness | Status |
|------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 2025 | 3x | 0.50 | Warning signs |
| 2026 | 20x | 0.25 | Sharp degradation |
| 2027 | 200x | 0.05 | Alignment failure |

**Outcome:** Catastrophic failure before corrective action possible.

### Scenario 4: Capability Plateau (P = 15%)

Scaling hits diminishing returns:

| Year | Capability | Robustness | Status |
|------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 2025 | 2x | 0.55 | Standard trajectory |
| 2027 | 5x | 0.45 | Plateau begins |
| 2030 | 10x | 0.40 | Stable |

**Outcome:** Time for alignment research; crisis averted by luck.

## Intervention Analysis

### Robustness-Improving Interventions

| Intervention | Effect on $R$ | Timeline | Feasibility |
|--------------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| Scalable oversight | +10-20% $R_{\text{train}}$ | 2-5 years | Medium |
| Interpretability | +10-15% $R_{\text{deploy}}$ | 3-7 years | Medium-Low |
| Formal verification | +5-10% all components | 5-10 years | Low |
| Process supervision | +5-10% $R_{\text{train}}$ | 1-2 years | High |
| Red teaming | +5-10% $R_{\text{deploy}}$ | Ongoing | High |
| Capability control | N/A—shifts timeline | Variable | Low |

### Research Priorities

Based on trajectory analysis, prioritize:

| Priority | Research Area | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | Scalable oversight | Addresses training alignment at scale |
| 2 | Interpretability | Enables verification of intent |
| 3 | Deception detection | Critical for threshold zone |
| 4 | Evaluation methods | Better measurement of robustness |
| 5 | Capability control | Buys time if other approaches fail |

<Aside type="tip" title="Bottom Line">
**The 10x-30x capability zone is critical.** Current research must produce usable techniques before this zone is reached (estimated 2-5 years). After this point, the alignment valley makes catching up significantly harder.
</Aside>

## Key Cruxes

Your view on alignment robustness trajectory should depend on:

| If you believe... | Then robustness trajectory is... |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Scaling laws continue smoothly | Worse (less time to prepare) |
| Deception requires very high capability | Better (more warning before crisis) |
| Current techniques generalize well | Better (degradation slower) |
| Interpretability is tractable | Better (verification possible) |
| AI systems will assist with alignment | Better (if we reach 30x+ aligned) |
| Sharp left turn is plausible | Worse (phase transition risk) |

## Limitations

1. **Capability measurement:** "×GPT-4" is a crude proxy; capabilities are multidimensional.

2. **Unknown unknowns:** Deception dynamics are theoretical; empirical data is sparse.

3. **Intervention effects:** Assumed additive; may have complex interactions.

4. **Single-model focus:** Real deployment involves ensembles, fine-tuning, and agent scaffolding.

5. **Timeline coupling:** Model treats capability and time as independent; they're correlated in practice.
