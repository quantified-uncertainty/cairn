This section explores detailed scenarios for how AI development might unfold.

## Scenario Categories

### Positive Scenarios
- **Aligned AGI**: Safe, beneficial superintelligence helps solve global problems
- **Slow Takeoff, Soft Landing**: Gradual capability gains allow continuous course correction
- **Governance Success**: International coordination prevents racing and misuse

### Negative Scenarios
- **Misaligned AGI**: Optimization for wrong objective leads to catastrophe
- **Racing to the Bottom**: Competition drives unsafe deployment
- **Lock-in**: Suboptimal values or power structures become permanent

### Mixed Scenarios
- **Transformative but Turbulent**: Major disruption, some catastrophes, eventual stability
- **Narrow AI Dystopia**: No AGI, but AI-enabled authoritarianism or inequality

## How Scenarios Relate

These scenarios aren't independent—they share common cruxes:
- Timeline length
- Takeoff speed
- Alignment difficulty
- Coordination success
