llmSummary: Analyzes whether competitive pressures between AI labs and nations
  will prevent safe AI development through coordination failures, examining
  evidence for both failure (US-China rivalry, regulatory lag, open source
  proliferation) and success (mutual destruction incentives, small number of key
  actors, emerging coordination efforts). Provides structured assessment of
  coordination modes with risk levels and expert disagreement spectrum ranging
  from 20% to 80%+ success probability.

**The core question**: Even if alignment is technically possible, will competitive pressures between labs and nations lead to racing, corner-cutting on safety, and ultimately catastrophe?

This is the "social" dimension of AI risk. Even with perfect technical solutions, coordination failures could prevent their adoption.

  ]}
/>

### The Tragedy of the Commons

**The structure**:
- Safety is a public good: everyone benefits if AI is safe
- But safety is costly: slower development, fewer features
- Each actor benefits by cutting corners while others are safe
- If everyone cuts corners, everyone loses

**Classic prisoner's dilemma**: Cooperation is collectively optimal, but defection is individually rational.

### First-Mover Advantage

**The argument**: Massive incentives to be first.

**Benefits of being first**:
- Capture market before competitors
- Accumulate more data → better models
- Set industry standards
- Achieve "moat" through scale
- Potentially achieve decisive strategic advantage

**Implication**: Safety measures that slow you down feel costly, even if they're globally optimal.

## Arguments for Coordination Failure

### 1. History of Coordination Failures

**The evidence**: Humans have repeatedly failed at similar problems.

**Examples**:
| Domain | Coordination Attempt | Result |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| Nuclear weapons | Non-proliferation | Partial success, 9 countries have nukes |
| Climate change | Paris Agreement | Insufficient, targets not met |
| Social media | Content moderation | Largely failed |
| Financial regulation | Basel accords | Mixed, still have crises |
| Bioweapons | BWC treaty | Some success, but weak verification |

**Key insight**: Coordination is possible but difficult and often incomplete.

### 2. US-China Competition

**The dynamic**: The two leading AI powers are geopolitical rivals.

**The problem**:
- Neither wants to fall behind
- Each fears the other will defect on safety
- Limited trust for verification
- Different values and governance systems
- Dual-use makes civilian/military separation hard

**The parallel**: Cold War arms race, but with AI instead of nukes.

**Key question**: Can rivals cooperate on existential risk?

### 3. Regulatory Lag

**The argument**: Government can't keep up with AI progress.

**Reasons for lag**:
- Technical complexity overwhelms regulators
- Revolving door with industry
- Lobbying against regulation
- Jurisdictional fragmentation
- Speed of AI progress

**Evidence**: Current AI governance is patchwork, varies by jurisdiction, often years behind technology.

### 4. Open Source and Proliferation

**The dilemma**: Open source democratizes AI but spreads dangerous capabilities.

**The case for open source**:
- Prevents monopoly
- Enables independent safety research
- Allows broader scrutiny
- Reduces concentration of power

**The case against**:
- Can't take back released capabilities
- Bad actors get access
- Can't control downstream use
- Safety features can be removed

**The meta-coordination problem**: Even if major labs agree on safety, open source efforts may not.

### 5. Value Disagreement

**The challenge**: No consensus on what "safe" or "aligned" means.

**Disagreements**:
- Whose values should AI reflect?
- How much autonomy should AI have?
- What risks are acceptable?
- Who decides deployment?

**Implication**: Even with will to coordinate, coordination on *what* is hard.

## Arguments for Successful Coordination

### 1. Mutual Destruction Motivates Cooperation

**The argument**: Everyone loses from catastrophe, so everyone has incentive to cooperate.

**The logic**:
- AI catastrophe is bad for all actors
- All parties know this
- Therefore, cooperation is mutually beneficial
- Self-interest aligns with coordination

**Historical parallel**: Cold War nuclear deterrence (we didn't have nuclear war).

**Counter**: This requires everyone to understand the risk. Disagreement about risk level undermines coordination.

### 2. Small Number of Key Actors

**The argument**: Only a few frontier labs to coordinate.

**Current frontier labs**: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, (Meta AI, xAI, others emerging)

**Advantages of small N**:
- Easier to negotiate
- Easier to monitor
- Easier to build trust
- Can make binding agreements

**Historical parallel**: Nuclear non-proliferation works better with fewer players.

**Counter**: More actors entering. Open source creates many actors.

### 3. Visible Progress on Cooperation

**The evidence**: Coordination efforts are forming.

**Current efforts**:
| Initiative | Type | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| AI Safety Institutes | National | UK, US, Japan, others |
| Bletchley Declaration | International | Signed by 28 countries |
| Frontier Model Forum | Industry | Major labs participating |
| RSPs / ASL | Self-regulation | Anthropic, others |
| EU AI Act | Regulation | Implemented |

**Key question**: Are these efforts sufficient?

### 4. Lab Incentives Favor Safety

**The argument**: Labs genuinely want safe AI, not just fast AI.

**Reasons**:
- Reputation matters
- Liability concerns
- Founders care about impact
- Safety is a selling point
- Don't want to cause catastrophe

**Evidence**: Major labs all have safety teams, publish safety research.

**Counter**: Competitive pressure may override internal incentives.

### 5. Historical Precedents of Success

**Examples of successful coordination**:
- Ozone layer (Montreal Protocol): Banned CFCs, hole is healing
- Smallpox eradication: Global coordination eliminated disease
- Nuclear taboo: No use since 1945
- Internet governance: IETF, ICANN work reasonably well
- Aviation safety: Remarkable safety record through coordination

**Key insight**: Coordination *can* work, especially when:
- Risks are clear
- Costs of cooperation are manageable
- Verification is possible
- Small number of key actors

## The Unilateral Action Problem

**The question**: Even if *you* act safely, will others?

| Unilateral Action Matters | Unilateral Action Is Futile |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Set norms and standards | Others won't follow |
| Buy time for coordination | Just delays the inevitable |
| Demonstrate feasibility | Cedes advantage to less careful |
| First-mover on safety creates pressure | Creates competitive disadvantage |
| Safety leader can later help others | Unsafe leader wins the race |

**The coordination dilemma**: If you unilaterally slow down for safety, you might:
- Demonstrate that safe development is possible (positive)
- Fall behind competitors who don't care (negative)
- Create pressure for others to follow (positive)
- Become irrelevant as less safe actors dominate (negative)

**Strategic insight**: The value of unilateral safety depends on whether others can be brought along.

## Mechanisms for Coordination

### Compute Governance

**The idea**: Control AI development by controlling the hardware.

**Mechanisms**:
- Export controls on advanced chips
- Licensing requirements for large training runs
- Monitoring of compute usage
- International agreements on compute

**Advantages**: Hardware is physical, visible, verifiable.

**Challenges**: Circumvention, innovation in efficiency, international cooperation.

### Responsible Scaling Policies (RSPs)

**The idea**: Labs commit to specific safety requirements at capability levels.

**How it works**:
1. Define capability thresholds (ASL levels at Anthropic)
2. Specify safety requirements for each level
3. Don't deploy until requirements met
4. External audit and verification

**Current status**: Anthropic has RSP; others have similar frameworks.

**Limitations**: Voluntary; relies on honest assessment; may not cover all risks.

### International Agreements

**The idea**: Nations agree on AI development rules.

**Possible forms**:
- Test ban (no systems above X capability)
- Development limits (no autonomous weapons)
- Mutual inspection
- Shared safety standards

**Challenges**: Verification, enforcement, US-China relations.

### Domestic Regulation

**The idea**: Governments regulate AI within their borders.

**Examples**:
- EU AI Act (risk-based regulation)
- US executive order (safety requirements)
- UK approach (principles-based)

**Limitations**: Varies by jurisdiction, enforcement is hard, risk of regulatory capture.

## What Would Change Your Mind?

### Evidence for coordination failure:
- Major lab breaks from safety commitments
- US-China relations deteriorate further
- Open source capabilities reach dangerous levels
- Regulation fails to pass or is captured
- Racing dynamic intensifies

### Evidence for successful coordination:
- Binding international agreement on AI safety
- Effective compute governance implemented
- Labs successfully enforce RSPs
- Meaningful US-China cooperation on AI
- Governance keeps pace with capability growth

## Implications for Action

### If Coordination Will Fail

**Strategy**:
- Focus on technical solutions that don't require coordination
- Build defensive capabilities
- Prepare for worst case
- Reduce dependency on AI cooperation

**Priority**: Technical alignment, containment, resilience

### If Coordination Is Possible

**Strategy**:
- Invest heavily in diplomatic and governance efforts
- Build institutions for cooperation
- Create verification mechanisms
- Foster trust between actors

**Priority**: Policy, governance, institution-building

### If Uncertain

**Strategy**:
- Pursue both technical and governance paths
- Build coordination capacity while developing technical solutions
- Seek cheap coordination wins
- Maintain optionality

**Priority**: Both technical and governance investment

## The Interaction with Other Cruxes

Coordination interacts with other cruxes:

- **[Timelines](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/timelines/)**: Short timelines make coordination harder.
- **[Takeoff Speed](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/takeoff/)**: Fast takeoff reduces time for coordination.
- **[Alignment Difficulty](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/alignment-difficulty/)**: If alignment is easy, less coordination needed.
- **[Warning Signs](/understanding-ai-risk/core-argument/warning-signs/)**: Warning shots might enable coordination.
