## Overview

The AI Transition Model is a causal framework for understanding how various factors influence the trajectory of AI development and its ultimate outcomes for humanity. It maps the relationships between:

- **Root Factors**: The underlying variables that shape AI-related scenarios
- **Ultimate Scenarios**: The pathways through which factors lead to outcomes
- **Ultimate Outcomes**: The final states we care about (catastrophe vs. positive trajectory)

This model helps identify:
1. **Leverage points**: Which factors have the most influence on outcomes
2. **Intervention targets**: Where effort can most effectively shift trajectories
3. **Key uncertainties**: Which causal relationships are most uncertain
4. **Scenario dependencies**: How different pathways interact

## Model Structure

The model flows through three levels: **Root Factors** → **Ultimate Scenarios** → **Ultimate Outcomes**.

### Two Ultimate Outcomes

<OutcomesTable client:load />

### Three Ultimate Scenarios

Ultimate Scenarios are the intermediate pathways connecting root factors to ultimate outcomes—they describe *how* factor changes lead to catastrophe or shape the long-term future.

### Seven Root Factors

Each root factor aggregates underlying parameters and influences ultimate scenarios:

## How Parameters, Risks, and Interventions Connect

Both **risks** and **interventions** connect to root factors:
- **Risks** (like deceptive alignment, racing dynamics) tend to *increase* harmful factors or *decrease* protective ones
- **Interventions** (like interpretability research, compute governance) work to counteract risks

**Interactive Views:**
- **[Parameter Table](/ai-transition-model/table)** - Sortable tables with ratings (changeability, uncertainty, x-risk impact, trajectory)
- **[Interactive Graph](/ai-transition-model-views/interactive)** - Clickable flow diagram with expandable nodes
- **[Graph View](/ai-transition-model-views/graph)** - Visual causal diagram showing relationships between factors, scenarios, and outcomes
- **[Outline View](/ai-transition-model-views/outline)** - Hierarchical text-based navigation with detailed descriptions

## All Parameters

For detailed information on all parameters including ITN (Importance, Tractability, Neglectedness) assessments, trends, and linked risks/interventions, see the **[Parameters Directory](/ai-transition-model/parameters/)**.

Key parameter categories:
- **Alignment**: Alignment robustness, safety-capability gap, interpretability coverage, human oversight quality, safety culture strength
- **Governance**: Coordination capacity, international coordination, regulatory capacity, institutional quality, racing intensity
- **Societal**: Societal trust, epistemic health, human agency, AI control concentration, economic stability
- **Resilience**: Societal resilience, biological/cyber threat exposure, information authenticity, human expertise

## Why This Framing Matters

### Traditional Risk Framing
- "Trust erosion is a risk we must prevent"
- "Concentration of power threatens democracy"
- Focus: Avoiding negative outcomes

### Parameter Framing
- "Trust is a parameter that AI affects in both directions"
- "Power distribution is a variable we can influence through policy"
- Focus: Understanding dynamics and identifying intervention points

The parameter framing enables:

1. **Better modeling**: Can estimate current levels, trends, and intervention effects
2. **Clearer priorities**: Which parameters matter most for good outcomes?
3. **Strategic allocation**: Where should resources go to maintain critical parameters?
4. **Progress tracking**: Are our interventions actually improving parameter levels?

## Relationship to Other Sections

| Section | Relationship to Parameters |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **Risks** | Many risks describe *decreases* in parameters (e.g., "trust erosion" = trust declining) |
| **Interventions** | Interventions aim to *increase* or *stabilize* parameters |
| **Metrics** | Metrics are *concrete measurements* of parameter levels |
| **Models** | Analytical models often estimate parameter dynamics and trajectories |

## How to Use This Section

### For Researchers
- Understand which underlying variables matter for AI outcomes
- Identify gaps between current and optimal parameter levels
- Design studies to measure parameter changes

### For Policymakers
- Prioritize interventions based on which parameters are most degraded
- Monitor parameter trends to assess policy effectiveness
- Coordinate across domains (a single parameter may affect multiple risks)

### For Forecasters
- Use parameters as input variables for scenario modeling
- Estimate how different interventions would shift parameter levels
- Identify tipping points where parameter degradation becomes irreversible
