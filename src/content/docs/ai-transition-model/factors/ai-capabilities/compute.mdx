Compute refers to the hardware resources required to train and run AI systems—GPUs, TPUs, and specialized accelerators. Training frontier models costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars in compute alone.

Compute is uniquely tractable for governance because it is **measurable** (FLOPs, GPU-hours), **concentrated** (few chokepoints like ASML, TSMC, NVIDIA), and **physical** (can be tracked and controlled).

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Changeability | 30 | Requires international coordination |
| X-risk Impact | 70 | Directly affects capability timelines |
| Trajectory Impact | 80 | Primary driver of AI advancement speed |
| Uncertainty | 35 | Hardware trends relatively predictable |
