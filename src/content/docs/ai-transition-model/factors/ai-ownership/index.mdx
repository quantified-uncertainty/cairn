## Overview

AI Ownership refers to who controls the most powerful AI systems and their outputs. Concentration among a few companies, countries, or individuals creates different risks than broad distribution. Ownership structure shapes incentives, accountability, and the distribution of AI benefits.

**For interactive exploration of how AI Ownership relates to other factors, see the [AI Transition Model Graph](/ai-transition-model-views/graph).**

## Key Dimensions

| Dimension | Description | Key Questions |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Countries** | Which nations control advanced AI | US-China dynamics, multipolar vs unipolar |
| **Companies** | Which corporations develop frontier AI | Lab concentration, profit vs safety |
| **Shareholders** | Who owns equity in AI companies | Concentration of wealth and influence |

## Relationship to Scenarios

AI Ownership primarily affects **Long-term Lock-in** scenarios:

- Concentrated ownership shapes what values and power structures get entrenched
- Ownership patterns determine accountability and reversibility
- Distribution of AI benefits affects social stability

Also affects:
- **[AI Takeover](/ai-transition-model/scenarios/ai-takeover/)**: Concentrated ownership could help or hurt depending on the actor
- **[Human-Caused Catastrophe](/ai-transition-model/scenarios/human-catastrophe/)**: Depends on who controls AI and their intentions

## Key Debates

| Debate | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Concentration effects | Is AI lab concentration good (easier to regulate) or bad (single points of failure)? |
| Profit vs safety | Can profit-motivated companies be trusted with AI safety? |
| Open source role | Does open source AI democratize capability or make dangerous systems accessible? |
| US-China dynamics | Is competition inevitable, or can cooperation emerge? |
