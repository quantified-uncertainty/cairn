Technical AI safety encompasses research and engineering practices aimed at ensuring AI systems reliably pursue intended goals. The field has grown from a niche academic concern to critical research, driven by evidence that advanced systems may develop [deceptive alignment](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/deceptive-alignment/) or engage in [scheming](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/scheming/).

Core challenges include [goal misgeneralization](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/goal-misgeneralization/) (60-80% of RL agents exhibit this in distribution-shifted environments) and the difficulty of supervising systems that may exceed human capabilities. Key approaches include [interpretability research](/knowledge-base/responses/alignment/interpretability/), [scalable oversight](/knowledge-base/responses/alignment/scalable-oversight/), and AI control methodologies that constrain systems regardless of internal alignment.

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Changeability | 45 | Moderately tractable; may require fundamental breakthroughs |
| X-risk Impact | 85 | Primary defense against catastrophic misalignment |
| Trajectory Impact | 70 | Alignment quality shapes long-term AI future |
| Uncertainty | 60 | Uncertain which approaches will work |
