This section explores different AI development timelines and their implications.

## Key Timeline Questions

1. **When will we see transformative AI (TAI)?**
2. **How fast will the transition from AGI to superintelligence be?**
3. **When will alignment need to be solved by?**

## Timeline Scenarios

### Short Timelines (2025-2030)
- Aggressive scaling continues working
- Current architectures reach AGI-level capabilities
- Limited time for safety research

### Medium Timelines (2030-2040)
- Some paradigm shifts required
- More time for safety work
- Governance can potentially catch up

### Long Timelines (2040+)
- Fundamental breakthroughs needed
- AI safety may be "solved" in time
- Different threat models apply

## Key Forecasting Resources
- Metaculus AI timelines
- Epoch AI compute trends
- Expert survey aggregations
