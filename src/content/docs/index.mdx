## What Is This?

This wiki maps the **landscape of AI existential risk**—the arguments, disagreements, organizations, and interventions that matter for ensuring advanced AI goes well for humanity.

Whether you're new to AI safety or a researcher looking for a comprehensive reference, this site aims to be your guide.
