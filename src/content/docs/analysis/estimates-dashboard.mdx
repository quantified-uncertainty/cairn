## Disagreement Summary

The AI safety field has significant disagreements on fundamental questions:

| Question | Range of Views | Implications |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Alignment difficulty | 10-90% chance current approaches fail | Research strategy |
| Takeoff speed | Days to decades | Warning shot availability |
| Primary risk source | Accidents vs misuse vs structural | Intervention focus |
| Timeline to TAI | 5-50+ years | Urgency level |
| Governance feasibility | Pessimistic to optimistic | Strategy emphasis |

## Methodology Notes

These estimates are aggregated from public statements, surveys, and publications. Key limitations:

- **Selection bias**: Researchers who publish estimates may differ systematically from those who don't
- **Anchoring**: Earlier estimates may anchor later ones
- **Vagueness**: Terms like "AGI" and "transformative AI" lack precise definitions
- **Updating**: Estimates change over time; dates shown indicate when recorded

For the most current estimates, consult primary sources like Metaculus, AI Impacts surveys, and direct researcher publications.
