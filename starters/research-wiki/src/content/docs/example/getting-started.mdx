## Using This Template

This starter comes pre-configured with Mermaid diagrams, math rendering, React, and Tailwind CSS. You can start adding content immediately.

### Quick Start

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the dev server (in a separate terminal): `npm run dev`
3. Open Claude Code in this directory: `claude`
4. Tell Claude what your research topic is and ask it to create your page structure
5. Watch your site update in real-time (default port: `http://localhost:4321`)

### Example Prompt

```
I'm building a research wiki about [YOUR TOPIC]. Create the following structure:

Sections:
1. [Section 1] — pages: [page-a], [page-b], [page-c]
2. [Section 2] — pages: [page-d], [page-e]
3. [Section 3] — pages: [page-f], [page-g], [page-h]

For each page:
- Create an MDX file in src/content/docs/ with appropriate subdirectories
- Include frontmatter with title and description
- Write a 2-3 paragraph introduction
- Add section headers for what the page will cover
- Include at least one Markdown table where relevant

Also:
- Delete the src/content/docs/example/ directory and its pages
- Update astro.config.mjs sidebar to use autogenerate for each section
- Update the site title to "[YOUR WIKI NAME]"
- Update the landing page (index.mdx) for the new topic
```

### Project Structure

```
src/content/docs/       # All wiki pages (MDX format)
src/components/         # React components
src/content.config.ts   # Content collection schema (don't delete)
astro.config.mjs        # Site config, sidebar, integrations
CLAUDE.md               # Instructions for Claude Code
public/                 # Static assets (create as needed for images)
```

### MDX Tips

- Escape dollar signs: `\$100` not `$100`
- Escape angle brackets in text: `\<100` not `<100`
- Use `.mdx` extension for all pages
- Use `---` for horizontal rules between sections

### Sidebar

The sidebar uses `autogenerate` based on directory structure. To add a new section, create a directory and add it to `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
sidebar: [
  { label: 'My Section', autogenerate: { directory: 'my-section' } },
]
```
