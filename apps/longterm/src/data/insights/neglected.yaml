      Multi-agent AI dynamics are understudied: interactions between multiple AI systems could produce emergent risks

      Non-Western perspectives on AI governance are systematically underrepresented in safety discourse, creating
      potential blind spots and reducing policy legitimacy.

      AI safety discourse may have epistemic monoculture: small community with shared assumptions could have systematic

      Agent safety is severely underfunded at $8.2M (6% of funding) versus the optimal 10-15% allocation, representing a
