    insight: Independent AI safety layers with 20-60% individual failure rates can achieve 1-3% combined failure, but
      deceptive alignment creates correlations (ρ=0.4-0.5) that increase combined failure to 12%+, making correlation
      reduction more important than strengthening individual layers.

    insight: Research shows that neural networks have made little to no progress on robustness to small distribution shifts
      over the past decade, and even models trained on 1,000 times more data than ImageNet do not close the gap between
      human and machine robustness.
