    insight: Independent AI safety layers with 20-60% individual failure rates can achieve 1-3% combined failure, but
      deceptive alignment creates correlations (ρ=0.4-0.5) that increase combined failure to 12%+, making correlation
      reduction more important than strengthening individual layers.
