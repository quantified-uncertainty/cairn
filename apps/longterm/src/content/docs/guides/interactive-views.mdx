## Overview

This page lists all the interactive tables, matrices, and graph visualizations available in the knowledge base. These views provide different ways to explore and compare data across the project.

:::tip[Quick Access]
Visit the **[Tables Gallery](/tables/)** for a visual overview of all comparison tables, or **[Cause-Effect Diagrams](/diagrams/)** for interactive causal graphs.
:::

## Intelligence Paradigms

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| <EntityLink id="architecture-scenarios/table">Architecture Scenarios Table</EntityLink> | Compare deployment patterns, base architectures, and non-AI paths to intelligence. Includes safety outlook ratings, research tractability, and key properties. |
| <EntityLink id="deployment-architectures/table">Deployment Architectures Table</EntityLink> | Compare how AI systems are deployed: API access, on-device, edge computing, etc. |

## Safety & Alignment

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| <EntityLink id="responses/safety-generalizability/table">Safety Generalizability Table</EntityLink> | Which safety approaches generalize across different AI architectures and deployment patterns. |
| <EntityLink id="responses/safety-generalizability/matrix">Safety × Architecture Matrix</EntityLink> | Matrix view showing compatibility between safety approaches and architecture scenarios. |
| <EntityLink id="responses/safety-generalizability/graph">Safety Generalizability Graph</EntityLink> | Graph visualization of safety approach relationships. |

## Risks

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| <EntityLink id="risks/accident/table">Accident Risks Table</EntityLink> | Compare accident/misalignment risks by severity, likelihood, and detectability. |

## Evaluations

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| <EntityLink id="models/eval-types/table">Eval Types Table</EntityLink> | Compare different evaluation methodologies for AI systems. |

## AI Transition Model

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Master Graph](/diagrams/master-graph/) | Full causal graph of AI transition model factors and relationships. |
| [AI Transition Model Views](/ai-transition-model-views/) | Interactive exploration of the AI transition model. |

## Entity Diagrams

Individual entity pages may also have cause-effect diagrams. See the [Cause-Effect Demo](/guides/cause-effect-demo/) for examples of how these work.
