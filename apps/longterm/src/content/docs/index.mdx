## What Is CAIRN?

**CAIRN** — **C**omprehensive **A**I **I**mpact & **R**isk **N**avigator — is a **decision-support tool** for AI safety prioritization. It helps funders, researchers, and policymakers answer: *"Where should the next marginal dollar or researcher-hour go?"*

Unlike traditional wikis that aim for comprehensive documentation, CAIRN focuses on **strategic clarity**: surfacing the key uncertainties and cruxes that, if resolved, would most change how resources should be allocated across AI safety interventions.

## This Wiki Is...

✅ **Comprehensive** — Covers technical, governance, and strategic perspectives

✅ **Structured** — Organized by cruxes, not just topics

✅ **Parameter-oriented** — Tracks foundational variables, not just risks

✅ **Interactive** — Timeline, risk maps, argument maps

✅ **Practical** — Career and funding guidance

---

## Limitations & Perspective

**This wiki is not neutral.** It was created within the AI safety community and reflects that perspective. While we strive to present counterarguments fairly, readers should be aware:

**What this wiki does well:**
- Steelmans the case for AI existential risk
- Maps the landscape of AI safety arguments, organizations, and research
- Presents the range of views *within* the AI safety community

**What this wiki does less well:**
- Representing perspectives that reject the x-risk framing entirely
- Engaging deeply with AI ethics/fairness concerns (often dismissed as "near-term")
- Covering non-Western perspectives on AI development
- Quantifying uncertainty honestly (probability estimates should be treated as rough intuitions)

**Key assumptions embedded in this wiki:**
- That "existential risk" is a coherent concept for AI
- That the theoretical arguments for concern (orthogonality, instrumental convergence) are basically sound
- That the AI safety community's research agenda is on the right track

**If you're skeptical of these assumptions**, this wiki may still be useful for understanding what AI safety researchers believe and why—but you should seek out alternative perspectives as well.

**Recommended alternative viewpoints:**
- <R id="9b1ab7f63e6b1b35">Gary Marcus's Substack</R> — AI skepticism
- <R id="81595c2c950080a6">Timnit Gebru et al.'s work</R> — AI ethics perspective
- <R id="4ca01f329c8b25a4">Yann LeCun's posts</R> — Skepticism of AGI/x-risk framing
- <R id="10202ee006b2ebdf">Emily Bender's work</R> — Linguistic critique of LLM capabilities
