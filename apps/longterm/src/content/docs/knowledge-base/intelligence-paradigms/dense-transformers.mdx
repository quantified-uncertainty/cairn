## Overview

Dense transformers are the **dominant architecture** for current frontier AI systems. "Dense" refers to the fact that all parameters are active for every token, in contrast to sparse/MoE architectures where only a subset activates.

Every major frontier model - GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini, Llama 3 - uses this architecture with relatively minor variations. The transformer architecture, introduced in "Attention Is All You Need" (2017), has proven remarkably scalable and general-purpose.

Despite having "open weights" for some models (Llama, Mistral), **interpretability remains fundamentally limited**. We can inspect billions of parameters but cannot meaningfully understand what the model "knows" or "intends."

### Key Components

| Component | Function | Parameters |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Embeddings** | Convert tokens to vectors | vocab_size × d_model |
| **Attention** | Learn relationships between positions | 4 × d_model² per layer |
| **FFN** | Process each position independently | 8 × d_model² per layer |
| **Layer Norm** | Stabilize training | 2 × d_model per layer |

### Scale of Current Models

| Model | Parameters | Layers | Context | Training Compute |
|-------|------------|--------|---------|------------------|
| GPT-4 | ~1.8T (rumored) | ~120 | 128K | ~\$100M+ |
| Claude 3 Opus | Unknown | Unknown | 200K | Unknown |
| Llama 3 405B | 405B | 126 | 128K | ~\$10M |
| Gemini Ultra | Unknown | Unknown | 1M+ | Unknown |

## Key Properties

| Property | Rating | Assessment |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **White-box Access** | LOW | Weights exist but mechanistic interpretability is primitive |
| **Trainability** | HIGH | Well-understood pretraining + RLHF pipeline |
| **Predictability** | LOW-MEDIUM | Emergent capabilities, phase transitions, unpredictable failures |
| **Modularity** | LOW | Monolithic, end-to-end trained, no clear component boundaries |
| **Formal Verifiability** | LOW | Billions of parameters, no formal guarantees possible |

## The Interpretability Paradox

A key insight: **"open weights" does not mean "interpretable."**

| What We Have | What We Don't Have |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Full parameter values | Understanding of what concepts are encoded |
| Activation patterns | Why specific outputs are generated |
| Attention maps | How to predict novel behaviors |
| Gradient information | Whether deceptive reasoning exists |

### State of Mechanistic Interpretability

| Capability | Status | Limitations |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Finding individual features | EMERGING | Only works for simple concepts in small models |
| Understanding circuits | EARLY | Very limited circuits understood |
| Predicting behavior | POOR | Cannot predict emergent capabilities |
| Detecting deception | UNKNOWN | No reliable methods exist |

## Safety Implications

### Challenges

| Challenge | Severity | Explanation |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Opaque internals** | HIGH | Cannot verify what model "believes" or "intends" |
| **Emergent capabilities** | HIGH | New abilities appear unpredictably at scale |
| **Phase transitions** | MEDIUM | Performance can change discontinuously |
| **Training data influence** | MEDIUM | Unknown what's learned from pretraining |
| **Deceptive alignment** | UNKNOWN | No way to detect if model is strategically deceiving |

### Current Safety Approaches

| Approach | Effectiveness | Limitation |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| **RLHF** | MEDIUM | Trains for stated preferences, not true values |
| **Constitutional AI** | MEDIUM | Still relies on model understanding instructions |
| **Red teaming** | LOW-MEDIUM | Only finds known failure modes |
| **Capability evals** | MEDIUM | Can measure but not prevent capabilities |

## Trajectory

### Current Status

Dense transformers are clearly dominant and will remain so in the near term. Key trends:

1. **Continued scaling** - Models getting larger, though returns may diminish
2. **Multimodality** - Vision, audio, video integration
3. **Longer context** - 100K+ token context windows
4. **Efficiency** - Better training and inference efficiency

### Future Uncertainty

| Question | Relevance |
|----------|-----------|
| Will scaling continue to improve capabilities? | Determines how long transformers remain dominant |
| Will MoE/sparse variants replace dense? | May shift to hybrid architectures |
| Can interpretability catch up to scale? | Determines whether safety research can keep pace |

## Comparison with Other Architectures

| Aspect | Dense Transformer | Sparse/MoE | SSM/Mamba |
|--------|-------------------|------------|-----------|
| Maturity | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW |
| Interpretability | LOW | LOW | UNKNOWN |
| Efficiency | MEDIUM | HIGH | HIGH |
| Capabilities | HIGHEST | HIGH | GROWING |
| Safety tooling | MOST | SOME | LITTLE |

## Implications for Safety Research

### Research That Works

- **Behavioral evaluations** - Testing model outputs
- **RLHF and variants** - Training for better behavior
- **Prompt engineering** - Eliciting safer responses
- **Red teaming** - Finding failure modes

### Research That Struggles

- **Mechanistic interpretability** - Understanding internals at scale
- **Formal verification** - Proving safety properties
- **Detecting deception** - Identifying strategic behavior
- **Predicting emergence** - Anticipating new capabilities

## Key Uncertainties

1. **Scaling limits**: Will dense transformers hit fundamental limits, or continue improving?

2. **Interpretability tractability**: Can mechanistic interpretability ever work at frontier scale?

3. **Architecture lock-in**: Are we stuck with transformers due to infrastructure investment?

4. **Safety ceiling**: Is there a fundamental limit to how safe dense transformers can be made?
