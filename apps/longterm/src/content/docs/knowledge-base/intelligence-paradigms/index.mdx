## Overview

This section explores different paradigms for building intelligent systems. Understanding architectural diversity helps anticipate which safety approaches may be needed and which risks are most relevant.

## Current Paradigms

### [Dense Transformers](/knowledge-base/intelligence-paradigms/dense-transformers/)
The dominant current architecture:
- Massive parameter counts, uniform activation
- Strong general capabilities
- Well-studied safety properties
- Examples: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini

### [Sparse MoE](/knowledge-base/intelligence-paradigms/sparse-moe/)
Mixture of Experts architectures:
- Conditional computation for efficiency
- Routing mechanisms select experts
- Potentially different failure modes
- Examples: Mixtral, Switch Transformer

### [SSM/Mamba](/knowledge-base/intelligence-paradigms/ssm-mamba/)
State Space Models:
- Alternative to attention mechanism
- Linear scaling with sequence length
- Emerging research area

### [Neuro-Symbolic](/knowledge-base/intelligence-paradigms/neuro-symbolic/)
Hybrid neural-symbolic systems:
- Combine learning with logical reasoning
- Potentially more interpretable
- Research stage

## Scaffolding Approaches

### [Minimal Scaffolding](/knowledge-base/intelligence-paradigms/minimal-scaffolding/)
Foundation models with basic prompting

### [Light Scaffolding](/knowledge-base/intelligence-paradigms/light-scaffolding/)
Chain-of-thought, few-shot learning

### [Heavy Scaffolding](/knowledge-base/intelligence-paradigms/heavy-scaffolding/)
Extensive tool use, agentic frameworks

## Alternative Pathways

### [World Models](/knowledge-base/intelligence-paradigms/world-models/)
Learning predictive world representations

### [Provably Safe](/knowledge-base/intelligence-paradigms/provable-safe/)
Architectures with formal safety guarantees

### Biological Approaches
- [Brain-Computer Interfaces](/knowledge-base/intelligence-paradigms/brain-computer-interfaces/)
- [Biological Organoid](/knowledge-base/intelligence-paradigms/biological-organoid/)
- [Genetic Enhancement](/knowledge-base/intelligence-paradigms/genetic-enhancement/)
- [Whole-Brain Emulation](/knowledge-base/intelligence-paradigms/whole-brain-emulation/)

### [Novel/Unknown](/knowledge-base/intelligence-paradigms/novel-unknown/)
Architectures not yet conceived

## Why Paradigms Matter for Safety

Different paradigms may have:
- Different failure modes and risk profiles
- Different amenability to interpretability
- Different alignment properties
- Different governance implications
