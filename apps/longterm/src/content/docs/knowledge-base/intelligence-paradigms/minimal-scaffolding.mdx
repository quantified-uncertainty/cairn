## Overview

Minimal scaffolding refers to the simplest way to deploy AI models: direct interaction through a chat interface with basic prompting, no persistent memory, and minimal or no tool access. This is how most people first experience AI - through ChatGPT's web interface or similar products.

While this was the dominant paradigm from 2022-2023, it is now **declining** as agentic systems demonstrate clear capability gains. Estimated probability of remaining dominant at transformative AI: **5-15%**.

The key characteristic is that **all capability comes from the model itself** - the scaffold adds almost nothing.

### What's Included

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Text input/output | YES | Core interaction |
| System prompts | YES | Basic behavior shaping |
| Conversation history | LIMITED | Within session only |
| Tool use | NO | No external capabilities |
| Persistent memory | NO | Resets each session |
| Multi-step planning | NO | Single turn only |

## Key Properties

| Property | Rating | Assessment |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **White-box Access** | LOW | Model internals completely opaque; only see inputs/outputs |
| **Trainability** | HIGH | Standard RLHF on base model |
| **Predictability** | MEDIUM | Single forward pass is somewhat predictable |
| **Modularity** | LOW | Monolithic model, no components |
| **Formal Verifiability** | LOW | Cannot verify anything about model behavior |

## Safety Profile

### Advantages

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Simple to analyze** | No complex multi-step behavior to reason about |
| **Limited harm potential** | No tool access means limited real-world impact |
| **Easy to monitor** | All interaction is visible |
| **Predictable scope** | Cannot take autonomous actions |

### Limitations

| Limitation | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| **Model is still opaque** | Cannot understand why outputs are generated |
| **Prompt injection** | Users can manipulate behavior through prompts |
| **Capability ceiling** | Cannot do tasks requiring tools or persistence |
| **No memory safety** | Cannot maintain safety constraints across sessions |

## Current Examples

| Product | Provider | Key Features |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| ChatGPT (free tier) | OpenAI | Basic chat interface |
| Claude.ai | Anthropic | Chat with file upload |
| Gemini | Google | Chat with multimodal input |
| Perplexity | Perplexity AI | Search-augmented chat |

## Why It's Declining

### Scaffolding Adds Clear Value

| Capability | Minimal | With Scaffolding |
|------------|---------|------------------|
| Web browsing | NO | YES |
| Code execution | NO | YES |
| File manipulation | NO | YES |
| Multi-step tasks | POOR | GOOD |
| Memory across sessions | NO | YES |

### Market Evidence

- ChatGPT Plus added code interpreter, browsing, plugins
- Claude added Artifacts, Projects, computer use
- Enterprise customers demand tool integration
- Developer APIs emphasize function calling

## Comparison with Other Deployment Patterns

| Aspect | Minimal | Light | Heavy |
|--------|---------|-------|-------|
| Capability | LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH |
| Safety complexity | LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH |
| Interpretability | LOW | MEDIUM | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| Development cost | LOW | LOW | MEDIUM |
| Current market share | DECLINING | STABLE | GROWING |

## When Minimal Scaffolding Makes Sense

Despite the trend toward agents, minimal scaffolding remains appropriate for:

1. **Brainstorming and ideation** - Don't need tools
2. **Writing assistance** - Text in, text out
3. **Learning and explanation** - Conversational Q&A
4. **Sensitive contexts** - Where tool access is dangerous
5. **Low-stakes tasks** - Where autonomy isn't needed

## Implications for Safety Research

### Research That Applies

- **Prompt engineering** - Eliciting better responses
- **RLHF and training** - Improving base model behavior
- **Jailbreak prevention** - Resisting adversarial prompts
- **Output filtering** - Catching harmful responses

### Research That's Less Relevant

- **Control/containment** - No tools to contain
- **Multi-agent safety** - Single agent only
- **Planning safety** - No multi-step planning
- **Tool safety** - No tools

## Key Uncertainties

1. **Will minimal persist for some use cases?** Even at TAI, some interactions may remain simple chat.

2. **Is the trend toward agents inevitable?** Or could safety concerns push back toward simpler systems?

3. **What's the capability ceiling?** How far can pure in-context learning go?
