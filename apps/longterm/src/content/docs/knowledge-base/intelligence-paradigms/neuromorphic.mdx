## Overview

Neuromorphic computing uses **brain-inspired hardware architectures** that process information using spiking neural networks (SNNs), event-driven computation, and often analog processing. Unlike standard GPUs that simulate neurons numerically, neuromorphic chips are designed to physically mimic neural dynamics.

The key advantages are **extreme energy efficiency** and **real-time processing**. The key limitation: they're **not competitive for AI capabilities** and are not on the current path to transformative AI.

Estimated probability of being dominant at transformative AI: **1-3%**

Even with perfect neuromorphic hardware, the software/algorithms aren't there.

## Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)

| Concept | Description | Relevance |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Spikes** | Binary events in time | Information encoding |
| **STDP** | Spike-timing dependent plasticity | Biological learning rule |
| **Leaky integrate-and-fire** | Neuron model | Computation unit |
| **Temporal coding** | Information in spike timing | Efficient representation |

### SNN vs ANN

| Aspect | Artificial NN (ANN) | Spiking NN (SNN) |

| Time | Usually ignored | Explicit, important |
| Hardware | GPUs | Neuromorphic |

## Trajectory

### Arguments for Relevance

1. **Energy limits** - AI training energy costs may force alternatives
2. **Edge computing** - Some applications need low power
3. **Brain-like properties** - Might enable capabilities ANNs lack
4. **Long-term** - Could leapfrog if fundamental advances

### Arguments Against

1. **Capability gap is enormous** - Decades behind transformers
2. **Investment** - Tiny compared to mainstream AI
3. **Software problem** - Even good hardware needs algorithms
4. **Converting ANNs** - Just run transformers on efficient hardware instead

## Key Uncertainties

1. **Could SNNs achieve capabilities ANNs can't?** Most researchers doubt this.

2. **Will energy constraints force neuromorphic?** Possible but not soon.

3. **Is there a "biological trick" we're missing?** What makes brains so efficient?

4. **Hybrid approaches?** Perhaps neuromorphic for some components.
