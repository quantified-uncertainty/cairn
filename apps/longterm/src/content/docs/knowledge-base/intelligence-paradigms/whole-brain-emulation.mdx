## Overview

Whole Brain Emulation (WBE), sometimes called "mind uploading," refers to creating a functional copy of a biological brain in a computational substrate. Unlike AI systems trained on data, a brain emulation would replicate the actual neural structure of a specific brain.

This was once considered a leading path to artificial general intelligence. The 2008 "Whole Brain Emulation Roadmap" by Sandberg and Bostrom at FHI provided detailed technical analysis. However, **progress has been much slower than AI**, and most researchers now expect AI to reach transformative capabilities first.

Estimated probability of being the dominant path to transformative intelligence: **&lt;1%**

### Key Technical Challenges

| Challenge | Current Status | Required Advance |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Scanning resolution** | ~1μm with electron microscopy | Need ~10nm for synapse detail |
| **Scanning speed** | Years for 1mm³ | Need hours for whole brain |
| **Preservation** | Plastination or vitrification | Must preserve all relevant detail |
| **Segmentation** | Mostly manual | Need fully automated at scale |
| **Neural modeling** | Simple neurons modeled | Need accurate synapse dynamics |
| **Compute** | ~10^18 FLOPS available | May need 10^18-10^25 FLOPS |

## Key Properties

| Property | Rating | Assessment |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **White-box Access** | LOW | Brain structure visible but not interpretable |
| **Trainability** | N/A | Copied from biological learning, not trained |
| **Predictability** | LOW | Human-like cognition is inherently unpredictable |
| **Modularity** | LOW | Brains are highly interconnected |
| **Formal Verifiability** | LOW | Too complex, poorly understood |

## Current Progress

### Achievements

| Milestone | Year | Details |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **C. elegans connectome** | 1986 | 302 neurons fully mapped |
| **OpenWorm simulation** | 2014 | Behavioral simulation of C. elegans |
| **Fruit fly connectome** | 2023 | ~140,000 neurons mapped |
| **Mouse cortical column** | Ongoing | Blue Brain Project |

### Scale Comparison

| Organism | Neurons | Connectome Status | Functional Simulation |
|----------|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| C. elegans | 302 | Complete | Partial |
| Fruit fly | 140,000 | Complete | No |
| Mouse | 70 million | Partial regions | No |
| Human | 86 billion | Not started | No |

## Safety Implications

### Potential Advantages

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Human values by default** | Emulation of human has human values (in theory) |
| **Understood entity type** | We have experience with humans |
| **Gradual development** | Progress is incremental and visible |
| **Legal/ethical frameworks** | Could extend human rights frameworks |

### Risks and Concerns

| Risk | Severity | Explanation |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Ethics of copying minds** | HIGH | Is the copy the same person? What rights does it have? |
| **Speed-up risk** | HIGH | Emulations could run 1000x+ faster than biological time |
| **Copy proliferation** | HIGH | Could create millions of copies |
| **Modification risk** | MEDIUM | Easier to modify than biological brains |
| **Value drift** | MEDIUM | Emulations may diverge from human values over time |
| **Identity issues** | MEDIUM | Psychological impact on emulations |

### Comparison with AI Safety

| Aspect | WBE | AI (Transformers) |
|--------|-----|-------------------|
| Value alignment | Starts aligned (human brain) | Must be trained/aligned |
| Interpretability | As opaque as human minds | Opaque but different |
| Speed of development | Slow, predictable | Fast, unpredictable |
| Controllability | Similar to humans | Unknown |
| Existential risk | Unclear | Actively debated |

## Economic and Social Implications

### Potential Impacts

| Impact | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Labor market** | Could create unlimited skilled labor (copies of experts) |
| **Economic growth** | Potentially explosive if emulations work faster |
| **Inequality** | Who gets emulated? Who controls emulations? |
| **Mortality** | Potential path to "immortality" for the wealthy |

### Robin Hanson's "Age of Em"

Economist Robin Hanson's book "The Age of Em" explores a world dominated by brain emulations:

- Emulations run at variable speeds (faster = more expensive)
- Copying creates perfect labor markets
- Wages driven to subsistence (compute costs)
- Extreme competition among emulation "clans"

| **Blue Brain Project** | Detailed cortical simulation | Active |
| **Allen Institute** | Brain mapping and connectomics | Active |
| **Academic neuroscience** | Basic research | Ongoing |

## Timeline Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario

| Milestone | Timeline | Probability |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Full mouse brain emulation | 2035-2040 | 20% |
| Proof-of-concept human region | 2040-2050 | 10% |
| Full human brain emulation | 2050-2070 | 5% |

### Pessimistic Scenario

| Milestone | Timeline | Probability |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Full mouse brain emulation | 2050+ | 50% |
| Full human brain emulation | Never achievable | 30% |

### Why It's Probably Not First

1. **AI is faster** - Deep learning progress is rapid; neuroscience is slow
2. **Scanning tech is far away** - Need major breakthroughs in electron microscopy
3. **Compute may be prohibitive** - Even if mapped, running it may be too expensive
4. **Unknown unknowns** - May need to capture aspects we don't yet understand

## Relevance to AI Safety

### Why Study WBE Despite Low Probability?

1. **Backup path** - If AI proves unalignably dangerous, WBE is an alternative
2. **Informs AI safety** - Understanding biological intelligence helps understand artificial
3. **Hybrid systems** - WBE insights may inform brain-computer interfaces
4. **Comparative analysis** - Different path illuminates unique AI risks

### Key Differences from AI Safety Concerns

| AI Safety Concern | WBE Equivalent |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Goal misgeneralization | Human values may be context-dependent |
| Mesa-optimization | Humans already have inner optimizers |
| Deceptive alignment | Humans can be deceptive |
| Capability overhang | Speed-up creates sudden capability jump |

## Key Uncertainties

1. **What level of detail is needed?** Do we need to simulate individual molecules, or is neuron-level sufficient?

2. **Is the connectome enough?** Or do we need dynamic state (hormones, neuromodulators, etc.)?

3. **What makes a mind continuous?** Is a copy "you"?

4. **Could emulations be safely contained?** If running faster than real-time, oversight becomes difficult.
