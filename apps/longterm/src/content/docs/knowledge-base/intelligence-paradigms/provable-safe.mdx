## Overview

Provable or "Guaranteed Safe" AI refers to approaches that aim to build AI systems with **mathematical safety guarantees** rather than empirical safety measures. The core premise is that we should be able to *prove* that an AI system will behave safely, not merely *hope* based on testing.

The most prominent current effort is **Davidad's Open Agency Architecture**, funded through the UK's ARIA (Advanced Research + Invention Agency) programme. This approach represents a fundamentally different philosophy from mainstream AI development: safety through formal verification rather than alignment through training.

Estimated probability of being dominant at transformative AI: **1-5%**. This is ambitious and faces significant scalability questions, but offers uniquely strong safety properties if achievable.

## Key Properties

| Property | Rating | Assessment |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **White-box Access** | HIGH | Designed for formal analysis from the ground up |
| **Trainability** | DIFFERENT | May use verified synthesis, not just gradient descent |
| **Predictability** | HIGH | Behavior bounded by formal proofs |
| **Modularity** | HIGH | Compositional by design for modular proofs |
| **Formal Verifiability** | HIGH | This is the core value proposition |

## The Open Agency Architecture

Davidad's Open Agency Architecture (OAA) is the most developed proposal for provably safe AI. Key components:

### Core Components

| Component | Function | Verification Approach |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| **World Model** | Formal representation of environment physics | Must be verifiably accurate for relevant domains |
| **Goal Specification** | Mathematical statement of what we want | Must be formally specified, not learned |
| **Bounded Planner** | Generates actions within proven safety bounds | Outputs must satisfy formal safety constraints |
| **Runtime Monitor** | Checks all actions against safety proofs | Blocks any action that can't be verified safe |

### Key Technical Challenges

| Challenge | Difficulty | Current Status |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **World model accuracy** | VERY HIGH | Core unsolved problem - how to verify the model matches reality? |
| **Specification completeness** | HIGH | Formal specs may miss important values/constraints |
| **Computational tractability** | HIGH | Verification can be exponentially expensive |
| **Capability competitiveness** | HIGH | Unknown if verified systems can match unverified ones |
| **Handling uncertainty** | MEDIUM | Formal methods traditionally assume certainty |

## Safety Implications

### Advantages

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Mathematical guarantees** | If proofs hold, safety follows logically, not probabilistically |
| **Auditable by construction** | Every decision can be traced to verified components |
| **Clear failure modes** | When something fails, you know *which* assumption was violated |
| **No emergent deception** | Behavior is bounded by proofs, not learned tendencies |
| **Compositionality** | Can build larger safe systems from smaller verified components |

### Limitations and Risks

| Limitation | Severity | Explanation |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **May not scale to AGI** | HIGH | Unknown if formal methods can handle AGI-level complexity |
| **Capability tax** | HIGH | Verified systems may be significantly less capable |
| **World model verification** | CRITICAL | The world model must be correct; this is extremely hard |
| **Specification gaming** | MEDIUM | System optimizes formal spec, which may miss true intent |
| **Implementation bugs** | MEDIUM | The implementation must match the formal model |

## Research Landscape

## Comparison with Other Approaches

| Aspect | Provable Safe | Heavy Scaffolding | Standard RLHF |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Safety guarantees | STRONG (if achievable) | PARTIAL (scaffold only) | WEAK (empirical) |
| Current capability | LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH |
| Scalability | UNKNOWN | PROVEN | PROVEN |
| Development cost | VERY HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW |
| Interpretability | HIGH by design | MEDIUM | LOW |

## Probability Assessment

### Arguments for Higher Probability (>5%)

1. **Strong safety incentives** - As AI gets more powerful, demand for guarantees may increase
2. **Regulatory pressure** - Governments may require formal verification
3. **ARIA funding** - Significant resources now dedicated to this approach
4. **Compositionality** - Verified components could be combined with other approaches

### Arguments for Lower Probability (&lt;1%)

1. **Capability gap** - Unverified systems may always be more capable
2. **Speed of AI progress** - May not develop fast enough before other approaches reach TAI
3. **World model problem** - Verifying world models may be fundamentally impossible
4. **Economic incentives** - Labs optimizing for capabilities won't adopt slower approach

## Key Uncertainties

1. **Can world models be verified?** The entire approach depends on having provably accurate world models. This is the crux.

2. **What's the capability ceiling?** We don't know if verified systems can be competitive with unverified ones.

3. **Can it handle novel situations?** Formal verification typically requires known domains; how to handle unprecedented situations?

4. **Will anyone adopt it?** Even if possible, will competitive pressures prevent adoption?

## Implications for Safety Research

### This Approach Changes the Game If...

- World model verification is solved
- Verified systems reach capability parity
- Regulatory frameworks require formal safety proofs
- A major AI accident increases demand for guarantees

### Research That Contributes

- **Formal methods** - Core verification techniques
- **World modeling** - Understanding physical systems
- **Specification learning** - Translating values to formal specs
- **Compositional verification** - Building larger proofs from smaller ones

## Timeline Considerations

| Milestone | Estimated Timeline | Confidence |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Proof-of-concept (limited domain) | 2025-2027 | MEDIUM |
| Competitive narrow AI | 2028-2032 | LOW |
| Competitive general AI | 2032+? | VERY LOW |
| TAI-level verified system | Unknown | SPECULATIVE |
