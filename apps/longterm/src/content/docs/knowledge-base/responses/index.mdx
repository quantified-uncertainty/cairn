## Overview

This section documents interventions and approaches being developed to address AI safety risks. Responses span technical research, governance mechanisms, institutional development, and public engagement.

## Response Categories

### [Technical Alignment](/knowledge-base/responses/alignment/interpretability/)
Research aimed at ensuring AI systems behave as intended:
- [Mechanistic Interpretability](/knowledge-base/responses/alignment/interpretability/) - Understanding model internals
- [RLHF](/knowledge-base/responses/alignment/rlhf/) - Reinforcement learning from human feedback
- [Constitutional AI](/knowledge-base/responses/alignment/constitutional-ai/) - Training with explicit principles
- [AI Control](/knowledge-base/responses/alignment/ai-control/) - Limiting AI autonomy regardless of alignment
- [Evaluations](/knowledge-base/responses/alignment/evals/) - Testing for dangerous capabilities

### [Governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/thresholds/)
Policy and regulatory approaches:
- [Compute Governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/thresholds/) - Controlling AI through hardware
- [Export Controls](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/export-controls/) - Restricting chip access
- [Responsible Scaling Policies](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/industry/responsible-scaling-policies/) - Lab commitments
- [Legislation](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/legislation/eu-ai-act/) - Government regulation

### [Institutions](/knowledge-base/responses/institutions/ai-safety-institutes/)
Organizations and structures for AI safety:
- [AI Safety Institutes](/knowledge-base/responses/institutions/ai-safety-institutes/) - Government research bodies
- [Standards Bodies](/knowledge-base/responses/institutions/standards-bodies/) - Technical standard development

### [Epistemic Tools](/knowledge-base/responses/epistemic-tools/coordination-tech/)
Technologies to preserve information integrity:
- [Coordination Technologies](/knowledge-base/responses/epistemic-tools/coordination-tech/) - Enabling cooperation
- [Content Authentication](/knowledge-base/responses/epistemic-tools/content-authentication/) - Verifying authentic media
- [Prediction Markets](/knowledge-base/responses/epistemic-tools/prediction-markets/) - Aggregating forecasts

### [Field Building](/knowledge-base/responses/field-building/training-programs/)
Growing the AI safety research community:
- [Training Programs](/knowledge-base/responses/field-building/training-programs/) - Researcher development
- [Corporate Influence](/knowledge-base/responses/field-building/corporate-influence/) - Engaging industry

## Evaluating Responses

Each response page includes assessments of:
- **Tractability** - How feasible is progress?
- **Neglectedness** - How much attention is it getting?
- **Potential Impact** - How much could it help if successful?

See the [Intervention Portfolio](/knowledge-base/responses/intervention-portfolio/) for comparative analysis.
