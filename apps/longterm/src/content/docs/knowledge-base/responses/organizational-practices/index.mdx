## Summary

Institutional approaches focus on **changing how organizations develop AI**, rather than technical solutions or external governance. The idea is that organizational culture, incentives, and practices significantly affect whether AI development is safe.

| **[Open Source](/knowledge-base/responses/organizational-practices/open-source/)** | Open vs. closed development and its safety implications |
| **[Pause](/knowledge-base/responses/organizational-practices/pause/)** | Proposals to pause or slow AI development |
