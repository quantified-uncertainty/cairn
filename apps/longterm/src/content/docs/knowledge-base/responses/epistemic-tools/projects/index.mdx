Key projects in the epistemic tools and forecasting space include:

- **[Squiggle](/knowledge-base/responses/epistemic-tools/projects/squiggle/)**: Probabilistic programming language for uncertainty quantification
- **[Metaforecast](/knowledge-base/responses/epistemic-tools/projects/metaforecast/)**: Cross-platform forecast aggregation
- **[SquiggleAI](/knowledge-base/responses/epistemic-tools/projects/squiggleai/)**: LLM-powered probabilistic model generation
- **[XPT](/knowledge-base/responses/epistemic-tools/projects/xpt/)**: Structured adversarial collaboration on existential risks
- **[ForecastBench](/knowledge-base/responses/epistemic-tools/projects/forecastbench/)**: Dynamic benchmark for AI forecasting capabilities
- **[AI Forecasting Benchmark Tournament](/knowledge-base/responses/epistemic-tools/projects/ai-forecasting-benchmark/)**: Human vs AI forecasting competition

These projects aim to improve decision-making on high-stakes questions, particularly around AI development and existential risk.
