## Overview

Prediction markets are platforms where participants trade contracts based on future event outcomes, with prices reflecting aggregate probability estimates. These markets outperform traditional polling by 60-75% in elections, achieving Brier scores of 0.16-0.24 on political events. Current market volumes range from \$100M+ (Kalshi) to \$1-3B annually (Polymarket), indicating growing mainstream adoption despite regulatory constraints.

For <EntityLink id="epistemic-infrastructure">epistemic infrastructure</EntityLink>, prediction markets offer unique advantages: they incentivize accuracy over ideology, aggregate dispersed information efficiently, and provide calibrated real-time probability estimates. Research by <R id="6de9674ebcc55023">Berg et al. (2008)</R> and <R id="d52dcf2e6c08b5b2">Wolfers & Zitzewitz (2004)</R> demonstrates their superior performance in information aggregation compared to expert polls or surveys.

## Current State & Applications

### Real-Money Markets

**Regulatory landscape**: The US maintains strict regulations through the <R id="7546a582e1adddff">CFTC</R>, limiting real-money markets to platforms like Kalshi with narrow question sets. Polymarket operates offshore using cryptocurrency, capturing \$1-3B in annual volume. The UK and EU allow broader prediction markets through established platforms like Betfair.

**Growth trajectory**: Polymarket's volume increased 10x from 2023 to 2024, driven by high-profile political events and crypto adoption. Kalshi continues expanding question categories under CFTC oversight.

### Play-Money Platforms

**Metaculus** leads in AI/science forecasting with 15,000+ active forecasters and track records dating to 2015. Research shows <R id="664518d11aec3317">superforecasters</R> on Metaculus achieve Brier scores of 0.15-0.19 on AI timeline questions.

**Manifold Markets** democratizes market creation, allowing users to generate questions on any topic. This creates coverage of niche issues but with lower average accuracy.

| Factor | Parameter | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| <EntityLink id="civilizational-competence" /> | <EntityLink id="epistemic-health" /> | Superior accuracy (60-75% vs polls) for aggregating expert beliefs on AI timelines |
| <EntityLink id="civilizational-competence" /> | <EntityLink id="institutional-quality" /> | Continuous probability updates enable adaptive policy responses |
| <EntityLink id="civilizational-competence" /> | <EntityLink id="societal-trust" /> | Transparent, verifiable forecasting mechanism reduces information asymmetry |

Prediction markets for AI outcomes face challenges including thin liquidity for long-horizon questions and limited participation from domain experts.
