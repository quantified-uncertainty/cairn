## Overview

Red teaming is a systematic adversarial evaluation methodology used to identify vulnerabilities, dangerous capabilities, and failure modes in AI systems before deployment. Originally developed in cybersecurity and military contexts, red teaming has become a critical component of AI safety evaluation, particularly for <EntityLink id="large-language-models">language models</EntityLink> and <EntityLink id="agentic-ai">agentic systems</EntityLink>.

Red teaming serves as both a capability evaluation tool and a safety measure, helping organizations understand what their AI systems can do—including capabilities they may not have intended to enable. As AI systems become more capable, red teaming provides essential empirical data for <EntityLink id="responsible-scaling-policies">responsible scaling policies</EntityLink> and deployment decisions.

## Risk Assessment

| Factor | Assessment | Evidence | Timeline |
|---------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Coverage Gaps** | High | Limited standardization across labs | Current |
| **Capability Discovery** | Medium | Novel dangerous capabilities found regularly | Ongoing |
| **Adversarial Evolution** | High | Attack methods evolving faster than defenses | 1-2 years |
| **Evaluation Scaling** | Medium | Human red teaming doesn't scale to model capabilities | 2-3 years |

## Key Red Teaming Approaches

### Adversarial Prompting (Jailbreaking)

| Method | Description | Effectiveness | Example Organizations |
|---------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Direct Prompts** | Explicit requests for prohibited content | Low (10-20% success) | <R id="f771d4f56ad4dbaa">Anthropic</R> |
| **Role-Playing** | Fictional scenarios to bypass safeguards | Medium (30-50% success) | <EntityLink id="metr">METR</EntityLink> |
| **Multi-step Attacks** | Complex prompt chains | High (60-80% success) | Academic researchers |
| **Obfuscation** | Encoding, language switching, symbols | Variable (20-70% success) | Security researchers |

### Dangerous Capability Elicitation

Red teaming systematically probes for concerning capabilities:

- **<EntityLink id="persuasion">Persuasion</EntityLink>**: Testing ability to manipulate human beliefs
- **<EntityLink id="deceptive-alignment">Deception</EntityLink>**: Evaluating tendency to provide false information strategically
- **<EntityLink id="situational-awareness">Situational Awareness</EntityLink>**: Assessing model understanding of its training and deployment
- **<EntityLink id="self-improvement">Self-improvement</EntityLink>**: Testing ability to enhance its own capabilities

### Multi-Modal Attack Surfaces

| Modality | Attack Vector | Risk Level | Current State |
|----------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| **Text-to-Image** | Prompt injection via images | Medium | Active research |
| **Voice Cloning** | Identity deception | High | Emerging concern |
| **Video Generation** | Deepfake creation | High | Rapid advancement |
| **Code Generation** | Malware creation | Medium-High | Well-documented |

## Current State & Implementation

### Evaluation Methodologies

| Approach | Scope | Advantages | Limitations |
|----------|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Human Red Teams** | Broad creativity | Domain expertise, novel attacks | Limited scale, high cost |
| **Automated Testing** | High volume | Scalable, consistent | Predictable patterns |
| **Hybrid Methods** | Comprehensive | Best of both approaches | Complex coordination |

## Key Challenges & Limitations

### Methodological Issues

- **False Negatives**: Failing to discover dangerous capabilities that exist
- **False Positives**: Flagging benign outputs as concerning
- **Evaluation Gaming**: Models learning to perform well on specific red team tests
- **Attack Evolution**: New jailbreaking methods emerging faster than defenses

### Scaling Challenges

Red teaming faces significant scaling issues as AI capabilities advance:

- **Human Bottleneck**: Expert red teamers cannot keep pace with model development
- **Capability Overhang**: Models may have dangerous capabilities not discovered in evaluation
- **Adversarial Arms Race**: Continuous evolution of attack and defense methods

## Timeline & Trajectory

### 2022-2023: Formalization
- Introduction of systematic red teaming at major labs
- <R id="ebab6e05661645c5">GPT-4 system card</R> sets evaluation standards
- Academic research establishes jailbreaking taxonomies

### 2024-Present: Standardization
- Government agencies develop evaluation frameworks
- Industry voluntary commitments include red teaming requirements
- Automated red teaming tools emerge

### 2025-2027: Critical Scaling Period
- **Challenge**: Human red teaming capacity vs. AI capability growth
- **Risk**: Evaluation gaps for advanced <EntityLink id="agentic-ai">agentic systems</EntityLink>
- **Response**: Development of AI-assisted red teaming methods

### Evaluation Completeness
**Core Question**: Can red teaming reliably identify all dangerous capabilities?

**Expert Disagreement**: 
- Optimists: Systematic testing can achieve reasonable coverage
- Pessimists: Complex systems have too many interaction effects to evaluate comprehensively

### Adversarial Dynamics
**Core Question**: Will red teaming methods keep pace with AI development?

**Trajectory Uncertainty**:
- Attack sophistication growing faster than defense capabilities
- Potential for AI systems to assist in their own red teaming
- Unknown interaction effects in multi-modal systems

## Integration with Safety Frameworks

Red teaming connects to broader AI safety approaches:

- **<EntityLink id="evaluation">Evaluation</EntityLink>**: Core component of capability assessment
- **<EntityLink id="responsible-scaling-policies">Responsible Scaling</EntityLink>**: Provides safety thresholds for deployment decisions
- **<EntityLink id="why-alignment-hard">Alignment Research</EntityLink>**: Empirical testing of alignment methods
