## Overview

AI evaluation encompasses systematic methods for assessing AI systems across safety, capability, and alignment dimensions before and during deployment. These evaluations serve as critical checkpoints in <EntityLink id="responsible-scaling-policies">responsible scaling policies</EntityLink> and government oversight frameworks.

Current evaluation frameworks focus on detecting <EntityLink id="__index__/ai-transition-model/factors/ai-capabilities">dangerous capabilities</EntityLink>, measuring alignment properties, and identifying potential <EntityLink id="deceptive-alignment">deceptive alignment</EntityLink> or <EntityLink id="scheming">scheming</EntityLink> behaviors. Organizations like <EntityLink id="metr">METR</EntityLink> have developed standardized evaluation suites, while government institutes like <EntityLink id="uk-aisi">UK AISI</EntityLink> and <EntityLink id="us-aisi">US AISI</EntityLink> are establishing national evaluation standards.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Severity | Likelihood | Timeline | Trend |
|---------------|----------|------------|----------|--------|
| Capability overhang | High | Medium | 1-2 years | Increasing |
| Evaluation gaps | High | High | Current | Stable |
| Gaming/optimization | Medium | High | Current | Increasing |
| False negatives | Very High | Medium | 1-3 years | Unknown |

## Technical Challenges

### Evaluation Gaming and Optimization

Modern AI systems can exhibit sophisticated gaming behaviors that undermine evaluation validity:

- **Goodhart's Law effects:** Metric optimization leading to capability degradation in unmeasured areas
- **Evaluation overfitting:** Models trained specifically to perform well on known evaluation suites

|----------|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| Novel capabilities | <EntityLink id="emergent-capabilities">Emergent capabilities</EntityLink> not covered by existing evals | High | Red team exercises, capability forecasting |
| Interaction effects | Multi-system or human-AI interaction risks | Medium | Integrated testing scenarios |
| Long-term behavior | Behavior changes over extended deployment | High | Continuous monitoring systems |
| Adversarial scenarios | Sophisticated attack vectors | Very High | Red team competitions, bounty programs |

### Scalability and Cost Constraints

Current evaluation methods face significant scalability challenges:

- **Computational cost:** Comprehensive evaluation requires substantial compute resources
- **Human evaluation bottlenecks:** Many safety properties require human judgment

- Can evaluation requirements keep pace with rapid capability advancement?

### Strategic Considerations

**Evaluation vs. Capability Racing:**
- Does evaluation pressure accelerate or slow capability development?
- Can evaluation standards prevent <EntityLink id="racing-dynamics">racing dynamics</EntityLink> between labs?
