  International AI governance encompasses treaties, summits, and coordination
  mechanisms between nations, with recent progress through AI Safety Summits and
  the Bletchley Declaration. Despite being critical for avoiding race-to-bottom
  dynamics, it remains severely underdeveloped due to great power competition
  and slow diplomatic processes.

## Overview

International AI governance represents a critical yet underdeveloped response to the global nature of AI risks. As AI development proceeds across multiple nations and organizations, the absence of international coordination creates dangerous race dynamics where competitive pressure may override safety considerations. Treaties, standards, and coordination mechanisms between nations offer the potential to prevent this race to the bottom, establish common safety requirements, and ensure that the benefits and risks of advanced AI are managed collectively rather than fragmenting into competing national interests.

The past two years have seen unprecedented diplomatic activity around AI safety, including the Bletchley AI Safety Summit (November 2023), the Seoul AI Safety Summit (May 2024), and the establishment of the UN AI Advisory Body. These efforts have produced initial agreements like the Bletchley Declaration, signed by 28 countries including the US, UK, China, and EU member states, acknowledging AI risks and committing to cooperation on frontier AI safety. However, these agreements remain largely declarative, lacking binding commitments or enforcement mechanisms.

The fundamental challenge lies in balancing national interests, economic competition, and security concerns against the shared interest in avoiding catastrophic AI outcomes. The US-China dynamic particularly complicates international coordination, as both nations view AI leadership as strategically essential while also recognizing certain shared risks. Successful international AI governance will likely require novel institutional arrangements that can operate effectively despite these tensions, potentially drawing lessons from arms control, nuclear non-proliferation, and climate governance while adapting to AI's unique characteristics.

## Quick Assessment

| Dimension | Grade | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Tractability** | C | Significant but difficult; diplomatic mechanisms exist |
| **Effectiveness** | A- (if achieved) | Essential for avoiding race dynamics |
| **Neglectedness** | B+ | Growing attention; severely underdeveloped |
| **Speed** | D+ | Inherently slow diplomatic processes |

## Risks Addressed

International coordination primarily addresses:

| Risk | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **<EntityLink id="racing-dynamics" />** | Coordinated slowdown; common standards | Very High if achieved |
| **Regulatory Arbitrage** | Harmonized requirements | High |
| **Capability Control** | Joint restrictions on frontier development | Medium-High |
| **Governance Gaps** | Comprehensive coverage | Medium-High |

## Limitations

- **Speed Mismatch**: Diplomatic processes much slower than AI development
- **Great Power Competition**: US-China rivalry limits comprehensive agreements
- **Enforcement Weakness**: International law lacks strong enforcement
- **Private Sector Gap**: State agreements don't bind companies directly
- **Definitional Challenges**: Difficult to define what's covered
- **Sovereignty Concerns**: Nations resist external constraints

## AI Transition Model Context

International AI governance affects the <EntityLink id="ai-transition-model" /> through coordination mechanisms:

| Factor | Parameter | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| <EntityLink id="governance-response-effectiveness" /> | International coordination | Enables collective action on AI risks |
| <EntityLink id="racing-dynamics" /> | Competitive pressure | Can reduce race dynamics through mutual commitments |
| <EntityLink id="policy-implementation-quality" /> | Global coverage | Prevents regulatory arbitrage |

International coordination is essential infrastructure for effective AI governance, but its slow development relative to AI capabilities creates significant implementation risk. Without meaningful international cooperation, national and corporate governance efforts may be undermined by competitive dynamics.
