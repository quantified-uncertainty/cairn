title: Compute Governance
description: >-
  Compute governance controls or monitors access to large-scale AI training compute as a means
  of regulating AI development. This is one of the few interventions that could directly slow
  frontier AI development, making it strategically important despite significant implementation
  challenges. Current measures include export controls on advanced chips and reporting requirements
  for large training runs.

## Overview

Compute governance refers to policies that control, monitor, or regulate access to the computational resources necessary for training large AI models. Unlike most AI safety interventions that operate at the model or deployment level, compute governance acts at the physical infrastructure level. Training frontier AI models requires enormous computational resources, concentrated in a relatively small number of data centers using specialized chips from a handful of manufacturers. This concentration creates potential leverage points for governance.

The strategic importance of compute governance is difficult to overstate. It represents one of the only mechanisms that could meaningfully slow frontier AI development if implemented effectively. While behavioral training, output filtering, and other safety measures shape how AI systems behave, compute governance can influence whether certain AI systems get built at all. This makes it uniquely valuable for buying time for safety research or preventing development races.

Current compute governance measures include US export controls on advanced AI chips to China (implemented in 2022, expanded in 2023), EU AI Act requirements for reporting large training runs, and Executive Order 14110 reporting requirements for models trained above certain compute thresholds. However, implementation faces significant challenges: algorithmic efficiency improvements reduce compute requirements over time, global coordination is difficult, and the technology is advancing faster than governance structures can adapt.

## Risk Assessment & Impact

| Dimension | Rating | Assessment |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Safety Uplift** | Medium-High | Only approach that can limit frontier development |
| **Capability Uplift** | Negative | Explicitly limits capability development |
| **Net World Safety** | Helpful | One of few interventions that could slow racing |
| **Lab Incentive** | Negative | Labs strongly opposed; limits competitive position |
| **Scalability** | Yes | Compute is physical and monitorable |
| **Deception Robustness** | N/A | External constraint, not model-level |
| **SI Readiness** | Partial | Could slow SI development; can't stop post-SI |

### Research Investment

- **Current Investment**: $5-20M/yr (GovAI, CSET, RAND; policy research)
- **Recommendation**: Prioritize (one of few levers to affect timeline; very underfunded)
- **Differential Progress**: Safety-dominant (explicitly slows capability development)

## How Compute Governance Works

Compute governance operates at multiple points in the AI development supply chain:

### Governance Mechanisms

| Mechanism | How It Works | Current Status |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Export Controls** | Restrict sale of advanced chips | US controls on China since Oct 2022 |
| **Training Run Reporting** | Require disclosure of large training runs | EO 14110 (>10^26 FLOP), EU AI Act |
| **Compute Thresholds** | Define regulatory triggers by compute scale | Various proposed thresholds |
| **KYC for Cloud** | Know-your-customer requirements for cloud providers | Limited implementation |
| **Hardware-Enabled Governance** | Technical features in chips for monitoring | Research stage |
| **International Coordination** | Agreements between nations | Early stage (Bletchley, Seoul) |

### Key Control Points

| Control Point | Why It Matters | Governance Potential |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Lithography Equipment** | Only ASML makes EUV machines | Very high (single supplier) |
| **Advanced Chips** | NVIDIA, AMD, Intel dominate | High (few suppliers) |
| **Cloud Providers** | AWS, Azure, GCP, some national | Medium (more distributed) |
| **Data Centers** | Physical concentration | Medium (many locations) |
| **Energy** | Large training uses significant power | Lower (widespread) |

## Current Governance Measures

### US Export Controls (Oct 2022, expanded 2023)

| Restriction | Target | Effect |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **Advanced chips** | H100, A100 | Blocked to China |
| **Chip-making equipment** | EUV machines | Blocked to China |
| **Cloud compute** | Training-as-a-service | Restricted |
| **Personnel** | US persons at Chinese chip firms | Work restrictions |

**Assessment**: Significant impact on Chinese frontier AI development, though China is investing heavily in domestic alternatives. Effectiveness decreases over time as alternatives emerge.

### EU AI Act Provisions

| Requirement | Threshold | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Registration** | GPAI models over threshold | Visibility |
| **Documentation** | Training data, evaluations | Accountability |
| **Risk Assessment** | For systemic risk models | Safety evaluation |

### US Executive Order 14110

| Requirement | Threshold | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Reporting** | Training runs >10^26 FLOP | Visibility into frontier development |
| **KYC** | Foreign access to US cloud | Prevent circumvention of export controls |

## Challenges and Limitations

### Implementation Challenges

| Challenge | Explanation | Severity |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Algorithmic efficiency** | Better algorithms reduce compute needs | High |
| **Global coordination** | Requires international cooperation | Very High |
| **Enforcement** | Verifying compliance is difficult | High |
| **Distributed compute** | Training across many smaller nodes | Medium |
| **Dual-use nature** | Same chips for beneficial AI | High |
| **Regulatory lag** | Technology moves faster than policy | High |

### The Algorithmic Efficiency Problem

| Timeframe | Observation | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Historical** | ~2x efficiency gain per 16 months | Compute requirements halve regularly |
| **Implication** | Threshold that matters today may not tomorrow | Thresholds must be updated |
| **Risk** | Governance may become obsolete | Need adaptive governance |

### Geopolitical Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Great power competition** | US-China rivalry complicates cooperation |
| **Sovereignty concerns** | Nations resist external control over their AI |
| **Coordination problems** | Collective action is difficult |
| **Enforcement asymmetry** | Democratic nations more constrained |
| **Economic interests** | Industry lobbying against restrictions |

## Key Cruxes

### Crux 1: Can Compute Be Effectively Governed?

| Position: Yes | Position: No |
|--------------|--------------|
| Physical goods are trackable | Algorithmic efficiency undermines thresholds |
| Supply chain concentrated | Global coordination is unrealistic |
| Precedent exists (nuclear materials) | Dual-use makes restrictions impractical |
| Investment in monitoring technology | Determined actors find workarounds |

### Crux 2: Is Slowing Development Desirable?

| Position: Yes | Position: No |
|--------------|--------------|
| Buys time for safety research | Cedes leadership to less responsible actors |
| Prevents racing dynamics | Slows beneficial AI development |
| Coordination reduces risk | May push development underground |
| Better to be safe than sorry | Economic and strategic costs too high |

### Crux 3: Should Compute Governance Be Prioritized?

| Position: Prioritize | Position: Limited Value |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| One of few levers on timeline | Governance fundamentally lagging |
| Underinvested currently | Better to invest in alignment |
| Necessary for any pause/slowdown | Can't govern what we can't track |
| Enables other governance | Technical limits to monitoring |

## Governance Proposals and Research

### Hardware-Enabled Governance

Research into technical mechanisms that could enable governance:

| Concept | Mechanism | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Compute monitoring** | Chips report usage to regulators | Research |
| **Licensing** | Chips require authorization to operate | Proposal |
| **Kill switches** | Remote disable capability | Controversial |
| **Workload verification** | Confirm training vs. inference | Research |

### Threshold-Based Governance

| Threshold Type | Example | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| **Compute** | >10^26 FLOP | Triggers reporting/oversight |
| **Capability** | Passes dangerous capability eval | Triggers restrictions |
| **Parameter count** | >100B parameters | Early proxy (now outdated) |

**Challenge**: Any fixed threshold becomes obsolete as efficiency improves.

### International Coordination

| Forum | Focus | Progress |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Bletchley Summit (2023)** | Risk awareness, safety commitments | Modest |
| **Seoul Summit (2024)** | Safety commitments, cooperation | Modest |
| **UN AI Advisory Body** | Global governance principles | Early stage |
| **Bilateral agreements** | US-UK, US-EU cooperation | Ongoing |

## Who Should Work on This?

**Good fit if you believe:**
- Timeline affects AI risk outcomes
- Governance can be made effective
- Coordination is achievable
- Physical constraints provide leverage

**Less relevant if you believe:**
- Algorithmic efficiency makes compute governance obsolete
- Global coordination is impossible
- Better to focus on alignment research
- Restrictions will fail and cause harms

## AI Transition Model Context

Compute governance affects the <EntityLink id="ai-transition-model" /> through multiple pathways:

| Parameter | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| <EntityLink id="capability-acceleration" /> | Could slow pace of capability advancement |
| <EntityLink id="racing-dynamics" /> | Could reduce competitive pressure if coordinated |
| <EntityLink id="safety-culture-strength" /> | Creates regulatory framework for safety |

Compute governance is strategically important because it operates at the infrastructure level rather than the model level. It's one of the few interventions that could affect AI development timelines rather than just deployment practices. However, its effectiveness depends heavily on international coordination and adaptation to algorithmic efficiency improvements.
