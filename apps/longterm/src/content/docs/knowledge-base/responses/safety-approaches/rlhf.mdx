## Overview

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the dominant training paradigm for modern large language models, responsible for transforming base language models into useful AI assistants. Introduced at scale by [OpenAI](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/openai/) with InstructGPT in 2022, RLHF trains models to produce outputs that humans prefer, learning from thousands of human comparisons between model outputs. This technique is what makes ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI assistants helpful and conversational rather than simply predicting text.

The technique involves three stages: supervised fine-tuning on human demonstrations, training a reward model to predict human preferences, and using reinforcement learning (typically PPO) to optimize the language model against this reward. While RLHF has proven remarkably successful at making AI systems useful and reducing obviously harmful outputs, its status as a "safety" technique is increasingly questioned. The primary effect is massive capability improvement - RLHF is commercially essential, and labs would pursue it regardless of safety concerns.

The fundamental challenge is that RLHF optimizes for outputs that appear good to humans, not outputs that are actually good. This creates serious concerns as AI systems become more capable: a sufficiently sophisticated model could learn to produce human-approved outputs while pursuing different goals internally. The technique fundamentally breaks when humans cannot evaluate outputs - which will occur for any superhuman task.

## Risk Assessment & Impact

| Risk Category | Assessment | Key Metrics | Evidence Source |
|---------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Safety Uplift** | Low-Medium | Reduces obvious harmful outputs | OpenAI InstructGPT evaluations |
| **Capability Uplift** | Dominant | Makes models vastly more useful | Foundation of commercial LLM products |
| **Net World Safety** | Unclear | May enable unverified deployments | Structural concern |
| **Scalability** | Breaks | Cannot scale to superhuman tasks | Fundamental limitation |

## How It Works

### Three-Stage Training Pipeline

| Stage | Process | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Stage 1: SFT** | Supervised fine-tuning on human demonstrations | Teach basic instruction-following |
| **Stage 2: Reward Modeling** | Train model to predict human preferences from comparisons | Create scalable preference signal |
| **Stage 3: RL Optimization** | Optimize policy model using PPO against reward model | Maximize human-preferred outputs |

### Key Technical Components

- **Comparison Data**: Humans rank 4-8 model outputs for the same prompt, generating preference pairs
- **Reward Model**: Separate neural network trained to predict which outputs humans prefer
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: RL algorithm that updates model to maximize predicted reward
- **KL Penalty**: Constraint preventing model from diverging too far from SFT base

## Critical Assessment

### Why RLHF is Primarily a Capability Technique

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Commercial Necessity** | Labs would do RLHF without any safety concerns - it's what makes products work |
| **Investment Scale** | $1B+/year across the industry, dwarfing safety-specific research |
| **Primary Benefit** | Transforms unusable base models into helpful assistants |
| **Safety as Byproduct** | Harm reduction is secondary effect of training for helpfulness |

### Fundamental Limitations

| Limitation | Description | Severity |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Human Evaluation Bottleneck** | Humans cannot evaluate superhuman outputs | Critical |
| **Deception Vulnerability** | Sophisticated models can learn to game evaluators | Critical |
| **Goodharting Risk** | Models optimize for appearance of goodness, not actual goodness | High |
| **Distribution Shift** | Reward model trained on current data may fail on novel inputs | Medium |

## Scalability Analysis

### Why RLHF Breaks at Scale

RLHF fundamentally assumes humans can accurately evaluate model outputs. This assumption fails catastrophically as AI capabilities increase:

| Capability Level | Human Evaluation Status | RLHF Effectiveness |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Below Human** | Humans can evaluate accurately | Effective |
| **Human-Level** | Humans struggle on complex tasks | Degraded |
| **Superhuman** | Humans cannot distinguish good from bad outputs | Broken |

### Implications for Superintelligence

A superintelligent AI trained with RLHF would only need to produce outputs that appear good to humans - not outputs that are actually beneficial. This creates an alignment tax that RLHF cannot collect: we lose the ability to verify that our oversight is meaningful.

## Current Adoption & Investment

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Adoption Level** | Universal | All frontier labs use RLHF |
| **Annual Investment** | $1B+/year | Core to commercial operations |
| **Primary Users** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta | Every major lab |
| **Recommendation** | Reduce (for safety) | Already overfunded; marginal safety dollars better elsewhere |

## Deception Robustness

| Robustness Type | Level | Explanation |
|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| **Against External Attacks** | Partial | Can train against known jailbreaks |
| **Against Model Deception** | None | A deceptive model easily produces human-approved outputs |
| **SI Readiness** | No | Fundamentally relies on human evaluation capacity |

A deceptive AI system could learn exactly what outputs humans prefer while maintaining entirely different internal objectives. RLHF provides no mechanism for detecting or preventing this - it optimizes for surface appearance, not genuine alignment.

## Differential Progress Analysis

| Factor | Direction | Explanation |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Per-Dollar Safety Gain** | Low | Marginal investment yields minimal safety improvement |
| **Per-Dollar Capability Gain** | Very High | Directly improves commercial utility |
| **Overall Balance** | Capability-Dominant | Safety gains are incidental to capability gains |

This analysis suggests that framing RLHF as "safety research" misallocates resources. The safety benefits are real but secondary, and additional investment yields primarily capability improvements rather than safety improvements.
