## Overview

Model registries and licensing requirements represent a foundational governance approach to AI safety, requiring developers and deployers of frontier AI systems to register their models with regulatory authorities and potentially obtain licenses before development or deployment. This administrative framework draws inspiration from established regulatory regimes in pharmaceuticals, aviation, and nuclear energy, where registration and licensing create accountability, enable oversight, and provide governments with visibility into potentially dangerous activities.

The approach addresses a fundamental information asymmetry problem: governments and the public currently have limited knowledge about what frontier AI systems exist, what capabilities they possess, and who is developing them. By requiring registration, regulators gain the ability to monitor the AI landscape, enforce safety requirements, and respond to emerging risks. Licensing can create additional gatekeeping functions, ensuring that only organizations meeting certain safety standards can develop or deploy advanced AI systems.

Current adoption remains experimental, with the EU AI Act establishing registration requirements for high-risk AI systems and the United States considering similar measures. However, significant implementation challenges remain, including defining appropriate thresholds for registration, ensuring international coverage to prevent regulatory arbitrage, and balancing transparency with protection of legitimate trade secrets.

## Risk Assessment & Impact

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence | Timeline |
|-----------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Safety Uplift** | Low-Medium | Provides visibility and accountability; doesn't directly improve model safety | Near-term |
| **Capability Uplift** | Tax (compliance burden) | Registration requirements impose administrative costs | Immediate |
| **Net World Safety** | Helpful | Enables oversight; valuable governance infrastructure | Medium-term |
| **Lab Incentive** | Negative | Compliance costs; reveals competitive information | Immediate |
| **Research Investment** | $5-15M/yr | Policy development; regulatory bodies | Current |
| **Differential Progress** | Safety-Dominant | Pure governance infrastructure | Ongoing |

### Registration Requirements

| Element | Description | Current Status | Challenges |
|---------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| **Threshold Definition** | Compute, capability, or deployment scale triggers | EU AI Act uses risk categories; US exploring compute thresholds | Setting appropriate thresholds |
| **Information Disclosure** | Training data, capabilities, safety measures | Varies by jurisdiction | Trade secret concerns |
| **Timeline Requirements** | Pre-deployment, post-deployment, or continuous | Generally post-deployment for current proposals | Pre-deployment may delay innovation |
| **International Scope** | Domestic only or extraterritorial | EU has extraterritorial scope | Enforcement across borders |

### Licensing Models

| Model Type | Description | Examples | Effectiveness |
|------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Activity-Based** | License required for specific activities (training, deployment) | Proposed for frontier AI | Creates clear gates |
| **Capability-Based** | License required above capability thresholds | Under discussion | Requires robust capability evaluation |
| **Risk-Based** | License tiers based on assessed risk level | EU AI Act approach | Flexible but subjective |
| **Organization-Based** | Licensed organizations can operate; others cannot | Nuclear regulatory model | High barrier to entry |

## Current Implementation Status

### EU AI Act

The EU AI Act, which entered into force in 2024, establishes the most comprehensive AI registration framework to date:

| Requirement | Scope | Timeline | Penalties |
|-------------|-------|----------|-----------|
| **High-Risk Registration** | Systems in listed categories | August 2025 onwards | Up to EUR 35 million or 7% revenue |
| **Database Entry** | Public database of high-risk AI | Rolling basis | Required for market access |
| **Documentation** | Technical documentation, conformity assessment | Pre-deployment | Market withdrawal for non-compliance |
| **GPAI Notification** | General-purpose AI model registration | August 2025 | Varies by risk tier |

### United States

| Initiative | Status | Scope | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Executive Order 14110** | Active | Compute reporting thresholds | >10^26 FLOP training runs |
| **SB 1047 (California)** | Vetoed (2024) | Would have required safety certifications | Influential despite veto |
| **Federal Legislation** | Under consideration | Various proposals | No comprehensive framework yet |
| **NIST AI RMF** | Voluntary | Risk management guidance | Not regulatory requirement |

### International Landscape

| Jurisdiction | Approach | Status |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| **China** | Algorithmic registration required | Implemented since 2023 |
| **UK** | Sector-specific approach proposed | Under development |

| Intervention | Synergy | Integration Approach |
|--------------|---------|---------------------|
| **<EntityLink id="dangerous-cap-evals" />** | Registries enable tracking; evals assess risk | Link registration to eval requirements |
| **<EntityLink id="compute-governance" />** | Compute thresholds can trigger registration | Unified reporting system |
| **<EntityLink id="rsp" />** | RSPs provide content; registries track commitments | Registry as accountability mechanism |
| **Third-Party Auditing** | Registries identify audit targets | Structured access for auditors |

### Key Uncertainties

| Uncertainty | Optimistic View | Pessimistic View |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **International Adoption** | Convergence toward common standards | Fragmented, ineffective patchwork |
| **Enforcement Effectiveness** | Sufficient deterrence | Under-resourced; widely evaded |
| **Threshold Appropriateness** | Captures relevant systems | Too high (misses risks) or too low (burdensome) |
| **Industry Cooperation** | Genuine engagement | Minimal compliance; regulatory capture |

## Quick Assessment

| Dimension | Grade | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Tractability** | B | Administrative mechanisms are implementable |
| **Effectiveness** | C+ | Enables oversight but doesn't directly improve safety |
| **Neglectedness** | B- | Growing attention; needs more development |
| **Speed** | C | Regulatory processes inherently slow |

## Risks Addressed

This intervention primarily addresses:

| Risk | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **<EntityLink id="racing-dynamics" />** | Visibility into development activities | Medium |
| **Capability Control** | Threshold-based gates | Medium |
| **Accountability Gaps** | Clear ownership and responsibility | Medium-High |
| **Regulatory Arbitrage** | Territorial coverage (if international) | Low-Medium |

## Limitations

- **Not a Safety Intervention**: Registration tracks systems but doesn't make them safer
- **Enforcement Dependent**: Only effective with robust enforcement capacity
- **Coverage Gaps**: Difficulty covering open-source, academic, and foreign development
- **Compliance Burden**: May disproportionately affect smaller, safety-conscious actors
- **Information Security**: Registries create attractive targets for adversaries
