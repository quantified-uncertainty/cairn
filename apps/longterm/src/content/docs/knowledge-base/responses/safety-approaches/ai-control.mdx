  AI Control is a safety paradigm that assumes potential misalignment and
  focuses on external constraints rather than trusting AI intentions. Led by
  Redwood Research, empirical studies show 80-95% detection rates for current
  models, offering 40-60% catastrophic risk reduction if alignment fails.
  Effectiveness may decrease significantly at superhuman capability levels.

## Overview

AI Control represents a paradigm shift in AI safety thinking: rather than assuming we can make AI systems genuinely aligned with human values, control approaches ask how we can safely deploy AI systems that might actively work against us. This defensive posture focuses on maintaining safety through external constraints, monitoring, and redundancy rather than trusting AI intentions. The approach has gained prominence through research led by Redwood Research, which has demonstrated that control protocols can provide meaningful safety benefits even against adversarially-behaving AI systems.

The fundamental insight driving AI Control is that alignment may prove intractable within the timelines of advanced AI development. If we cannot reliably ensure AI systems want to help us, we must instead ensure they cannot harm us regardless of their intentions. This separation of the alignment problem (ensuring AI wants the right things) from the control problem (ensuring safety regardless of what AI wants) enables concrete, testable progress on safety measures while alignment research continues.

Current empirical work suggests AI Control can provide 40-60% reduction in catastrophic risk if alignment fails, with 80-95% detection rates against adversarial behavior from current frontier models. However, these protocols face a fundamental scalability challenge: as AI systems approach and exceed human-level capabilities, the defender's advantage may erode. The critical question for AI Control is whether protocols can be developed that remain effective against superintelligent systems, or whether control is primarily a bridge strategy until alignment is solved.
