## Summary

This section covers interventions that expand AI safety capacity: training programs, community building, funding infrastructure, and public awareness. These meta-level approaches aim to multiply the impact of direct research and policy work by growing the talent pipeline.

For detailed analysis of field-building effectiveness, including growth metrics and cost-per-career-change data, see [Field Building Analysis](/knowledge-base/responses/field-building/field-building-analysis/).
