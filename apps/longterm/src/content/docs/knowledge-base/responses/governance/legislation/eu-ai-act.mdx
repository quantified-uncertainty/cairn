## Overview

The EU AI Act represents the world's first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence regulation, entering force on August 1, 2024. This landmark legislation establishes a risk-based regulatory approach that categorizes AI systems by potential harm, with increasingly stringent requirements for higher-risk applications. The Act fundamentally reshapes the AI landscape by introducing binding legal obligations for AI developers and deployers operating in European markets.

From an AI safety perspective, the Act introduces groundbreaking provisions for <EntityLink id="large-language-models">general-purpose AI models</EntityLink> trained with more than 10^25 floating-point operations. These systems must undergo mandatory adversarial testing, comprehensive risk assessments, and continuous monitoring for dangerous capabilities. The legislation creates crucial precedents that influence regulatory discussions globally, with enforcement mechanisms including penalties up to €35 million or 7% of global annual turnover.

The Act's enforcement establishes the EU AI Office as a dedicated regulatory body for advanced AI oversight. While primarily focused on near-term harms rather than existential risks, its framework for monitoring advanced AI capabilities provides important infrastructure for addressing severe risks as systems become increasingly powerful.

## Risk Assessment Framework

| Risk Category | Classification Criteria | Key Requirements | Penalty Range |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Prohibited** | Unacceptable risk to fundamental rights | Complete ban on deployment | €35M or 7% revenue |
| **High-Risk** | Critical infrastructure, employment, law enforcement | Conformity assessment, human oversight, documentation | €15M or 3% revenue |
| **GPAI Systemic** | >10^25 FLOP training threshold | Red-teaming, incident reporting, cybersecurity | €35M or 7% revenue |
| **Limited Risk** | Transparency concerns (chatbots, deepfakes) | Disclosure requirements | €7.5M or 1.5% revenue |

### Prohibited AI Systems

The Act bans AI practices deemed to pose unacceptable risks to fundamental rights and safety:

- **Social scoring systems** by governments (modeled after concerns about China's social credit system)
- **Real-time remote biometric identification** in publicly accessible spaces (limited law enforcement exceptions)
- **Subliminal manipulation techniques** exploiting vulnerabilities of specific groups
- **Emotional manipulation** targeting children or vulnerable populations

## Safety Impact Analysis

### Strengths for AI Safety

| Aspect | Contribution | Global Influence |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Legal Precedent** | First binding safety requirements for frontier AI | Template for other jurisdictions |
| **Red-teaming Mandate** | Required adversarial testing for systemic risk models | Industry standard establishment |

## Key Uncertainties and Critical Questions

### Technical Challenges

**Threshold Evolution**: The 10^25 FLOP metric faces challenges from:
- More efficient training architectures reducing compute requirements
- Test-time compute scaling shifting performance bottlenecks
- Distributed training approaches complicating measurement

<R id="6d3e85b51201e286">Epoch AI research</R> suggests 40-60% efficiency improvements possible through architectural innovations alone.

### Regulatory Effectiveness

| Uncertainty | Expert Assessment | Timeline |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **Cross-border coordination** | 60% expect significant challenges | 2025-2026 |
| **Open source model governance** | 75% see regulatory gaps | Ongoing |
| **Threshold gaming prevalence** | 70% expect moderate-high gaming | 2026-2028 |
| **International harmonization** | 45% expect convergence with US/UK | 2027-2030 |

### Global Regulatory Competition

The Act's international influence depends on competing approaches:

- **US approach**: Emphasis on <EntityLink id="voluntary-commitments">voluntary commitments</EntityLink> and executive orders
- **UK framework**: Principles-based regulation through existing sectoral authorities  
- **China model**: State-directed governance with national security focus
- **Singapore approach**: Regulatory sandboxes and innovation-friendly policies

### Adaptation Mechanisms

**Legislative Review**: The Act includes provisions for review and potential revision by 2029, with earlier updates possible through delegated acts for technical specifications.

**Stakeholder Engagement**: Ongoing consultation mechanisms with industry, academia, and civil society to inform implementation and identify emerging challenges.

**International Coordination**: Cooperation frameworks with other jurisdictions to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent global standards.
