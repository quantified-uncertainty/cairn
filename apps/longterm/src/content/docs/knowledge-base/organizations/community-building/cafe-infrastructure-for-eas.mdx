## Overview

Cafe infrastructure for the Effective Altruism community encompasses a range of physical spaces that facilitate collaboration, networking, and community building for individuals working on high-impact causes. These spaces range from purpose-built coworking facilities and conference venues to informal cafe meetups that serve as gathering points for EA practitioners, AI safety researchers, and rationalist community members.

The infrastructure landscape has evolved significantly over the past decade. Early EA community building relied heavily on informal gatherings at public cafes and borrowed spaces, following the "third place" model where intellectual communities form around accessible public venues. This gradually shifted toward dedicated facilities designed specifically for the EA ecosystem, driven by the growing concentration of AI safety researchers and EA professionals in key hubs like San Francisco and Berkeley. The evolution reflects broader debates within EA about resource allocation—whether community infrastructure represents effective use of movement resources or diverts funds from direct impact work.

Major facilities today include Mox SF, a mission-driven coworking space in San Francisco's Mission District housing approximately 150 members including researchers from <EntityLink id="anthropic">Anthropic</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="openai">OpenAI</EntityLink>, and <EntityLink id="metr">METR</EntityLink>[^1]; Lighthaven, a ~30,000 square foot campus in Berkeley operated by Lightcone Infrastructure (the team behind <EntityLink id="lesswrong">LessWrong</EntityLink>)[^2]; and CEEALAR in Blackpool, UK, which provides free or subsidized accommodation and coworking space, operating at a fraction of the cost of higher-profile venues[^3]. These spaces serve overlapping but distinct functions—some prioritize direct AI safety research collaboration, others focus on broader community building and fellowship programs.

## Evolution from Informal to Dedicated Spaces

The EA community's approach to physical infrastructure has undergone several distinct phases. In the movement's early years, community building occurred primarily through meetups at public venues—traditional cafes serving as convenient, low-cost gathering points. The Berkeley EA community, for example, historically used venues like Caffe Strada, Asha Tea House, and 1951 Coffee Company as informal headquarters[^2]. These locations provided the social infrastructure needed for community formation without requiring dedicated funding or management overhead.

This informal model aligned with early EA principles emphasizing cost-effectiveness and avoiding overhead spending. Public cafes offered what urban planners call "third places"—social environments distinct from home and work that facilitate community formation and intellectual exchange. For distributed movements like EA, such spaces provided crucial function: a physical location where community members could reliably find each other, discuss ideas, and coordinate activities.

The shift toward dedicated facilities began as EA organizations grew and concentrated geographically, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. Berkeley REACH (Rationality and EA Community Hub) represented an intermediate stage—a dedicated venue with couches, tables, coworking space, and scheduled activities like exercise pomodoros, but operating on a modest scale[^2]. The facility has since closed, reflecting the ongoing experimentation with different infrastructure models.

The current landscape features purpose-built facilities with substantially greater investment. Lighthaven's ~30,000 square foot campus in downtown Berkeley serves approximately 40 weekly workers and ~140 individuals with access, hosting conferences, research programs, and fellowships with both indoor and outdoor areas[^2]. This represents a qualitative shift from borrowed or adapted spaces to infrastructure designed specifically for EA community needs.

## Major Facilities and Their Models

### Mox SF

Mox SF operates at 1680 Mission Street in San Francisco's Mission District, serving approximately 150 members including researchers from major AI safety organizations. The space is explicitly mission-driven rather than profit-seeking, offering subsidized rates to make high-quality coworking accessible to individuals working on impactful causes[^1].

The facility provides tiered membership options: private offices accommodate up to four people for \$3,200 per month, while dedicated desks cost \$800 per month[^1]. Amenities include conference rooms, a gym, nap room, and subsidized meals—infrastructure designed to support intensive research work while reducing the friction of daily logistics. Run by Rachel Shu, Mox also hosts incubation programs and fellowships including PIBBSS, Seldon, and Catalyze Impact[^1].

Mox's guest program offers two free visits per month, lowering barriers to entry for individuals exploring the EA community or collaborating with members[^1]. This approach balances financial sustainability with accessibility—charging enough to maintain operations while keeping rates below market rate for purpose-aligned individuals. The model reflects broader EA infrastructure debates: how to fund community spaces in ways that don't exclude talented individuals with limited resources while maintaining quality facilities that attract and retain top researchers.

### Lighthaven and Lightcone Infrastructure

Lighthaven represents one of the largest dedicated EA/rationalist community facilities, operating as a ~30,000 square foot campus in downtown Berkeley. The space is run by Lightcone Infrastructure, the team responsible for operating <EntityLink id="lesswrong">LessWrong</EntityLink>, connecting online and offline community infrastructure[^2].

The facility serves approximately 40 regular weekly workers and provides access to around 140 individuals, functioning as both coworking space and event venue. Lighthaven hosts conferences, research programs, and fellowships, utilizing a mix of indoor and outdoor areas to accommodate different types of activities[^2]. The scale allows for simultaneous use by multiple groups—routine coworking continuing while larger events or programs run in dedicated spaces.

Lighthaven's model emphasizes flexibility and community access rather than traditional coworking economics. By operating under the umbrella of an established EA organization (Lightcone Infrastructure), the facility can pursue objectives beyond financial self-sufficiency, treating community space provision as part of the organization's broader mission to support rationalist and EA communities.

### Constellation

Constellation, operated by <EntityLink id="redwood-research">Redwood Research</EntityLink> in downtown Berkeley, represents a more organizationally-focused model. The facility primarily houses approximately 30 Redwood Research staff while also providing space for researchers from <EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="arc">ARC</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="cea">CEA</EntityLink>, AI Impacts, Atlas Fellowship, <EntityLink id="miri">MIRI</EntityLink>, Lightcone, Alvea, and GCP[^2].

This approach differs from the open coworking model of spaces like Mox SF. Constellation functions more as shared organizational infrastructure, allowing multiple aligned organizations to benefit from proximity and shared facilities while maintaining clearer organizational boundaries. The model may offer advantages for organizations requiring more control over their physical environment or handling sensitive research, while still enabling the cross-pollination benefits of co-location with allied groups.

### CEEALAR (Blackpool, UK)

CEEALAR (formerly the EA Hotel) in Blackpool, UK, operates on a distinctly different model from Bay Area facilities, emphasizing maximum accessibility through free or highly subsidized accommodation, communal vegan meals, coworking space, and a moderate stipend[^3]. Operating since 2018, CEEALAR has hosted retreats for organizations including Allfed and Orthogonal, serving functions similar to higher-profile venues at a fraction of the cost[^3].

The facility is funded through 2025 with plans for an AI safety fellowship in 2026[^3]. CEEALAR's model addresses a critical gap in EA infrastructure: providing support for individuals who are highly capable and aligned with EA priorities but lack the financial resources to participate in the community full-time or relocate to expensive hub cities. By covering basic needs and providing a supportive community environment, CEEALAR enables individuals to focus on high-impact work without immediate financial pressure.

The trade-offs are notable. Blackpool's location outside major EA hubs means less regular interaction with leading researchers and organizations compared to Bay Area facilities. However, for certain types of work—particularly independent research, writing, and project development—the reduced costs and supportive community environment may outweigh proximity benefits. CEEALAR's existence also provides an important comparison point for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of different infrastructure models within the EA ecosystem.

### Emerging and Regional Facilities

The EA Infrastructure Fund (EAIF) has supported the establishment of community spaces beyond the Bay Area hubs. The New York EA Hub (NYEAH), established by EA NYC in partnership with <EntityLink id="cea">CEA</EntityLink>, provides coworking space, event venue, and meeting facilities in Manhattan[^2]. This reflects growing recognition that EA community building benefits from regional hubs rather than concentration in a single geographic area.

FAR Labs operates as an AI safety-focused coworking space, offering both short-term visitor access and long-term memberships[^2]. The specialized focus on AI safety research distinguishes it from broader EA community spaces, potentially enabling deeper technical collaboration among researchers working on related problems.

## Funding and Resource Allocation

Community infrastructure funding primarily flows through several channels: direct organizational investment (Redwood Research's Constellation, Lightcone's Lighthaven), subsidized membership models (Mox SF), philanthropic support (CEEALAR), and grants from EA funding bodies including the EA Infrastructure Fund.

The EA Infrastructure Fund has distributed over \$9.2 million in total grants by August 2022, supporting projects that expand the EA community through evidence-based, impartial altruism[^4][^5]. Infrastructure grants have funded local and university EA groups with "high epistemic integrity," coworking spaces that facilitate collaboration and allow newcomers to observe community norms, retreats and conferences, and epistemic tools like Guesstimate and Manifold Markets[^4]. Recent grant rounds have distributed \$1.39 million to 41 projects between June 2023 and March 2024[^5].

EAIF's approach has shifted toward "principles-first" funding, supporting people who live by EA principles (scope-sensitive, impartial welfarist views) rather than focusing narrowly on specific cause areas[^4][^5]. This philosophical orientation affects infrastructure funding—spaces that facilitate broad EA community building and enable individuals to apply EA principles across domains receive support alongside more targeted AI safety or global health initiatives.

The resource allocation debate remains active within the EA community. Critics argue that funding cafes and community infrastructure prioritizes movement growth over proven interventions with measurable impact on global health or existential risk reduction[^6]. This criticism stems from broader concerns about EA becoming self-referential, investing in its own expansion rather than the ultimate goals that motivated the movement. Defenders counter that community infrastructure enables talent development, coordination, and retention that ultimately increases impact on priority cause areas—though measuring these effects remains challenging[^7].

## Community Building vs. Direct Impact

The tension between investing in community infrastructure and directly funding high-impact interventions reflects deeper debates about EA movement strategy. One perspective frames this as "cause-first" versus "member-first" approaches[^7]. Cause-first strategy prioritizes funneling resources and talent to the highest-impact opportunities as currently understood, making community building instrumental to that end. Member-first approach builds supportive infrastructure that enables EA-aligned individuals to live according to EA principles across domains, treating the community as valuable in itself.

Measurement challenges complicate this debate. Direct interventions like distributing malaria nets or funding AI safety research offer clearer metrics for assessing impact. Community infrastructure effects are more diffuse—career trajectory changes, collaboration that wouldn't otherwise occur, retention of talented individuals who might otherwise leave the movement. Critics warn of "streetlight fallacy" risks: overweighting easily measured direct impacts while undervaluing harder-to-quantify community effects[^7].

The collapse of FTX and its associated funding highlighted infrastructure vulnerability. Many EA organizations and community spaces had relied on FTX-linked funding, with approximately \$30 million flowing to EA causes[^8]. The sudden withdrawal of this support when FTX collapsed forced rapid adjustments and raised questions about sustainable funding models for community infrastructure. Some spaces closed or scaled back; others secured alternative funding or shifted to more financially sustainable models.

## Traditional Cafes and Third Places

Despite the growth of dedicated facilities, traditional cafes continue playing important roles in EA community building. The Berkeley EA community maintains connections to venues like Caffe Strada, Asha Tea House, and 1951 Coffee Company, which serve as accessible gathering points requiring no membership or formal affiliation[^2].

These informal "third places" offer distinct advantages. They require no dedicated funding to maintain, making them resilient to funding fluctuations. They're accessible to newcomers who might find dedicated EA spaces intimidating or exclusive. They enable casual encounters and conversations that might not occur in more formal settings. And they connect EA community members to broader intellectual and cultural communities in their cities, reducing insularity.

The concept of third places—social environments distinct from home and work—has long been recognized in urban planning and sociology as crucial for community formation. For intellectual and activist movements, these spaces provide venues where ideas can be discussed, relationships formed, and collective action coordinated without requiring formal organizational structure. Coffee houses historically served this function for various intellectual movements, from the Enlightenment-era coffeehouses of London to the Beat Generation's gathering spots in 1950s San Francisco[^9].

EA's hybrid approach—maintaining connections to traditional cafes while investing in dedicated facilities—attempts to capture benefits of both models. Dedicated spaces enable deeper collaboration and provide professional-quality infrastructure for serious research work. Traditional cafes maintain accessibility, lower barriers to entry, and prevent complete separation from broader intellectual communities.

## Criticisms and Concerns

Infrastructure investment faces several persistent criticisms within and outside the EA community. Resource diversion arguments suggest that funding physical spaces prioritizes movement growth over proven high-impact interventions[^6]. This concern intensifies when considering opportunity costs: the resources devoted to maintaining facilities in expensive cities like San Francisco and Berkeley could alternatively fund significant amounts of direct work on global health, animal welfare, or even AI safety research itself.

Insularity and echo chamber risks arise when communities develop extensive dedicated infrastructure. EA-specific spaces naturally attract EA-committed individuals, potentially reducing exposure to outside perspectives and critical feedback. Critics note this can lead to "monoculture" effects where group norms and beliefs reinforce each other without adequate challenge, potentially undermining the epistemic rigor EA claims to value[^10].

Geographic concentration in high-cost areas creates barriers to participation. While facilities like CEEALAR attempt to address this through subsidized models, the ecosystem remains heavily weighted toward San Francisco and Berkeley—cities with extremely high living costs. This concentration may exclude talented individuals from lower-income backgrounds or locations who cannot afford relocation or even short-term participation, potentially narrowing the movement's demographic and intellectual diversity.

The collapse of Wytham Abbey as an EA venue illustrates reputational risks associated with high-profile infrastructure. <EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink> had acquired the historic property near Oxford for use as a conference venue, but public criticism of the purchase's optics—a historic manor for a movement claiming to prioritize cost-effectiveness—contributed to its eventual sale[^2]. The episode highlighted how community infrastructure decisions face public scrutiny that may not apply to less visible expenditures.

Sustainability concerns extend beyond funding to operational models. Many facilities rely on below-market rates subsidized by philanthropic funding or organizational support. This creates ongoing funding needs and vulnerability to changes in philanthropic priorities. Alternative models attempting financial self-sufficiency face challenges balancing accessibility with revenue requirements—a tension particularly acute for communities that value openness and inclusivity.

## Effectiveness and Ongoing Debates

Evaluating cafe infrastructure effectiveness remains methodologically challenging. Unlike distributing malaria nets or funding technical research, infrastructure effects operate primarily through enabling other activities rather than producing direct measurable outcomes. Potential mechanisms include: facilitating collaborations that produce research or projects; accelerating career development through mentorship and skill-sharing; improving retention of talented individuals who might otherwise leave the movement; and enabling coordination that wouldn't occur through digital communication alone.

Some evidence suggests positive effects. EAIF managers report being "impressed by cross-cause models and low-cost events," with conference costs around \$92 per attendee proving highly cost-effective compared to larger events like EA Global[^5]. Coworking spaces enable "positive externalities" through collaboration and allowing newcomers to observe community norms[^5]. However, these assessments remain qualitative and subject to selection effects—people using and funding these spaces naturally tend to view them positively.

Cost-effectiveness comparisons with alternative infrastructure models receive less systematic attention. CEEALAR's model—providing comprehensive support at far lower cost than Bay Area facilities—offers an important comparison point. If similar community building and talent development can occur at substantially lower cost, this challenges the necessity of high-investment facilities in expensive cities. Conversely, if proximity to leading AI labs and research organizations produces qualitatively different outcomes, higher costs may be justified for specific functions.

The "principles-first" versus cause-specific framing adopted by EAIF reflects ongoing strategic uncertainty[^4]. Should EA infrastructure primarily support people committed to EA reasoning methods across domains, or focus more narrowly on talent development for priority causes? This question connects to broader debates about EA's identity—whether it's fundamentally a philosophical approach to doing good that should be widely spread, or a coordination mechanism for addressing specific high-priority problems.

Digital infrastructure and virtual community building offer potential alternatives or complements to physical spaces. <EntityLink id="lesswrong">LessWrong</EntityLink> and the EA Forum enable community formation and intellectual exchange without physical co-location. Video conferencing and collaboration tools continue improving, potentially reducing the necessity of physical proximity. However, proponents of physical infrastructure argue that certain types of collaboration, trust-building, and community formation remain difficult or impossible through purely digital channels.

## Key Uncertainties

Several questions remain unresolved about optimal approaches to EA community infrastructure:

**Scale and distribution**: Should the EA community concentrate infrastructure investment in a few major hubs with critical mass, or distribute resources across more regional spaces? Concentration enables denser networks and more frequent high-quality interactions; distribution reduces geographic barriers and may increase demographic diversity.

**Accessibility versus specialization**: Should spaces prioritize broad accessibility to maximize community growth, or specialize in serving specific functions like AI safety research collaboration? Different models serve different purposes, but funding constraints require prioritization.

**Financial sustainability**: What role should market-rate pricing, subsidized models, and pure philanthropic support play in funding community infrastructure? More sustainable models reduce funding vulnerability but may exclude individuals without financial resources.

**Counterfactual impact**: How much does dedicated infrastructure change outcomes compared to alternative scenarios where the same individuals used existing public spaces or digital communication tools? This core effectiveness question remains difficult to answer rigorously.

**Optimal investment level**: At what point do additional infrastructure investments face diminishing returns or opportunity costs that exceed benefits? EA's overall resource constraints mean infrastructure funding necessarily trades off against direct work on priority causes.

These uncertainties reflect community infrastructure's complexity and the difficulty of measuring effects that operate primarily through enabling and supporting other activities rather than producing direct measurable outcomes.
