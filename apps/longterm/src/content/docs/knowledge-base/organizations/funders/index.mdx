## Overview

Longtermist funders provide critical financial support for organizations working on AI safety, existential risk reduction, and related cause areas. The funding landscape is characterized by a relatively small number of major philanthropists and foundations that provide the majority of resources, with additional support from regranting programs and smaller donors.

The field has experienced significant growth in funding over the past decade, though it remains small relative to overall AI development spending. Major shifts occurred in 2022-2023 with the FTX collapse eliminating a significant planned funding source, though other funders have partially filled the gap.

### Key Individual Philanthropists

| Person | Net Worth | Annual Giving | AI Safety | Lifetime Total | Primary Vehicle |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Bill Gates** | ≈\$130B | ≈\$5B | Minimal | \$50B+ | Gates Foundation |
| **<EntityLink id="elon-musk-philanthropy">Elon Musk</EntityLink>** | ≈\$400B | ≈\$250M | Minimal | ≈\$8B | Musk Foundation |

### AI Safety Funding Concentration

The AI safety funding landscape is highly concentrated among a few donors:

| Funder | AI Safety (Annual) | % of Total AI Safety Funding |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| <EntityLink id="coefficient-giving">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> | \$65M | ≈55% |
| <EntityLink id="sff">Survival and Flourishing Fund</EntityLink> | \$30M | ≈25% |
| <EntityLink id="jaan-tallinn">Jaan Tallinn</EntityLink> (direct) | \$10M | ≈8% |
| <EntityLink id="vitalik-buterin-philanthropy">Vitalik Buterin</EntityLink> | \$5-15M | ≈5-10% |
| <EntityLink id="ltff">Long-Term Future Fund</EntityLink> | \$5-10M | ≈5% |
| Other sources | \$5-10M | ≈5% |
| **Total estimated** | **≈\$120-150M/year** | **100%** |

### Untapped Philanthropic Potential

Several major philanthropists have significant resources but minimal AI safety engagement:

| Person | Net Worth | Current AI Safety | Potential (1% of net worth) |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| <EntityLink id="elon-musk-philanthropy">Elon Musk</EntityLink> | \$400B | ≈\$0 | \$4B/year |
| Mark Zuckerberg | \$200B | \$0 | \$2B/year |
| Bill Gates | \$130B | Minimal | \$1.3B/year |
| Larry Ellison | \$230B | \$0 | \$2.3B/year |
| Jeff Bezos | \$200B | \$0 | \$2B/year |

If these five individuals allocated just 1% of their net worth annually to AI safety, it would represent **\$11.6B/year** — roughly **80x current total funding**.

### The Scale Gap

| Category | Annual Funding | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| **AI Safety (total)** | ≈\$120-150M | Highly concentrated |
| **Gates Foundation alone** | ≈\$7,000M | 50x AI safety total |
| **AI capabilities (industry)** | ≈\$50,000M+ | 400x AI safety total |
| **Global philanthropy** | ≈\$500,000M | 4,000x AI safety total |

## Recent Trends

**2024-2025 Developments:**
- Coefficient Giving launched \$40M AI Safety Request for Proposals (January 2025)
- SFF allocated \$34.33M, with 86% going to AI-related projects
- Coefficient Giving (formerly Open Philanthropy) rebranded in November 2025
- LTFF continued steady grantmaking at ≈\$5M annually

**Post-FTX Landscape:**
- Future Fund's collapse eliminated ≈\$160M in committed grants
- Some organizations faced funding crises; others found alternative support
- Field-wide diversification of funding sources
