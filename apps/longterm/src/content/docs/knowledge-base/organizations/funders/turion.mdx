## Overview

Turion Space is an aerospace company that designs, builds, and operates spacecraft for critical orbital operations including space domain awareness, in-space servicing, and debris mitigation.[^1] Founded in 2020 by aerospace engineers with SpaceX backgrounds, the company has rapidly scaled from concept to operational satellites, launching its first spacecraft (DROID.001) within 18 months of founding.[^2]

The company's core mission focuses on building platforms that can actively perform tasks in orbit rather than simply observing space. This includes satellite servicing, debris removal, satellite inspection, and tactical intelligence gathering for both national security and commercial customers.[^3] Turion employs approximately 150 employees and has demonstrated significant traction with both venture capital investors and government contracts, particularly from the U.S. Space Force.[^1]

While the company's immediate focus is on space domain awareness and servicing operations, CEO Ryan Westerdahl has articulated a long-term vision for asteroid mining, viewing current operations as building blocks toward that 15-year goal.[^4]

## History

### Founding and Early Development

Turion Space was founded in 2020 by Ryan Westerdahl, Patryk Wiatr, and Tyler Pierce, who brought complementary expertise in aerospace engineering, business, and advanced technology from their prior roles at SpaceX.[^5] Westerdahl, who spent nine years at SpaceX in failure analysis, sold his commercial real estate holdings to fund the company's initial operations.[^4] The founding team was motivated by both near-term opportunities in space domain awareness and a longer-term vision for asteroid mining.[^4]

In summer 2021, the company participated in the Y Combinator accelerator program, which helped establish early business connections and credibility.[^6] Around the same time, Turion secured four early-stage Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts through the Orbital Prime program from the U.S. Department of the Air Force and Space Force.[^4] These initial contracts expanded into multi-double-digit million-dollar contracts, providing crucial non-dilutive funding.[^4]

### Rapid Satellite Development

In a demonstration of exceptional execution speed, Turion developed its first operational satellite, DROID.001, in under 18 months from company founding.[^2] This rapid development cycle showcased the team's vertical integration capabilities and technical expertise. DROID.001 was successfully launched in June 2023 and has remained operational for over 20 months, completing more than 100 imaging missions in 2024 alone.[^7]

### Growth and Expansion (2024-2025)

In 2024, Turion raised nearly \$20 million in venture capital, including an oversubscribed Series A funding round.[^8] The company also secured significant government contracts, including a \$15 million STRATFI contract and a \$1.9 million TACFI contract from the U.S. Space Force's SpaceWERX.[^9] By mid-2025, the company had grown to approximately 120-150 employees and exceeded \$10 million in annual revenue.[^4]

March 2025 saw the launch of DROID.002, the company's second satellite with enhanced capabilities.[^1] In December 2024, Turion won a \$32.6 million fixed-price contract from the U.S. Space Force to build three satellites with rendezvous proximity operations, high-resolution satellite-to-satellite imagery, and real-time command and control capabilities, with completion scheduled for October 2028.[^10]

### Recent Strategic Moves

In January 2026, Turion acquired Tychee Research Group, a Los Angeles-based company, integrating their TMPL mission-planning software into Turion's Starfire ecosystem.[^11] According to CEO Ryan Westerdahl, this acquisition emphasized the critical role of software in scaling spacecraft operations, enabling unified mission engineering, maneuver optimization, and autonomous operations.[^11]

In March 2025, the company selected Blink software modem technology from Amphinicy Technologies for ground communications on its DROID satellites, enabling high-speed data downlink and supporting plans to scale operations.[^12]

## Technology and Capabilities

### DROID Satellite Fleet

Turion's DROID (Deployable Responsive Orbital Inspection Device) satellite series forms the core of the company's operational capabilities. DROID.001, a 32-kg spacecraft launched in June 2023, has demonstrated flight heritage and proven the company's technical approach.[^7] Data from DROID.001 has been integrated into the U.S. Space Force's Unified Data Library, validating its utility for government customers.[^7]

DROID.002, launched in March 2025, features larger size and enhanced imaging capabilities compared to its predecessor.[^7] A third satellite, DROID.003, is scheduled for launch in 2026, while DROID Alpha is planned for early 2025 with enhanced mobility for non-Earth imaging, servicing, and debris removal operations.[^1]

The company is also developing a micro-DROID variant for a 2026 demonstration mission co-funded by NASA, which will test debris capture capabilities using specialized grapplers.[^7] Turion has announced plans to scale production to 45 satellites annually by 2027.[^7]
