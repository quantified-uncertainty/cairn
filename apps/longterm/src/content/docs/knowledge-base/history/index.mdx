## Overview

This section traces the development of AI safety as a field, from early theoretical concerns to the current mainstream recognition of AI risks. Understanding this history helps contextualize current debates and institutional structures.

## Historical Eras

### [MIRI Era (2000-2015)](/knowledge-base/history/miri-era/)
The field's founding period, dominated by the Machine Intelligence Research Institute:
- Eliezer Yudkowsky's early writings on AI risk
- Founding of SIAI (later MIRI) in 2000
- Development of foundational concepts (orthogonality thesis, instrumental convergence)
- *Superintelligence* (2014) brings ideas to academic attention

### [Deep Learning Era (2015-2022)](/knowledge-base/history/deep-learning-era/)
Deep learning breakthroughs reshape the landscape:
- AlphaGo (2016) demonstrates superhuman capability
- GPT-2 (2019) shows language model potential
- Anthropic founded (2021) by former OpenAI safety team
- Growing recognition in ML community

### [Early Warnings (2022-2023)](/knowledge-base/history/early-warnings/)
AI safety enters public consciousness:
- ChatGPT (Nov 2022) captures public attention
- Pause letter (March 2023) signed by prominent researchers
- Geoffrey Hinton leaves Google to speak freely about risks
- Congressional hearings on AI safety

### [Mainstream Era (2023-Present)](/knowledge-base/history/mainstream-era/)
AI safety becomes a policy priority:
- Biden Executive Order on AI (Oct 2023)
- Bletchley Park AI Safety Summit (Nov 2023)
- AI Safety Institutes established globally
- Major labs adopt responsible scaling policies
