This page documents <EntityLink id="sam-altman">Sam Altman</EntityLink>'s public predictions and claims to assess his epistemic track record.

## Summary Assessment

| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Clearly Correct** | 3-4 | AI needing massive capital, cost declines, legal/medical AI assistance |
| **Partially Correct** | 3-4 | GPT-4 limitations, AI productivity gains, agents emerging |
| **Pending/Testable** | 8-10 | AGI by 2025-2029, superintelligence by 2030, job displacement |
| **Clearly Wrong** | 2-3 | Self-driving cars (2015), ChatGPT Pro profitability, GPT-5 launch |
| **Self-Corrected** | 1 | AI creativity (acknowledged he was wrong) |

**Overall pattern**: Directionally correct on AI trajectory; consistently overoptimistic on specific timelines; rhetoric has shifted from "existential threat" to "will matter less than people think."

## Predictions: Wrong or Overstated

| Date | Claim | What Happened | Assessment | Source |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|--------|
| **2015** | Self-driving cars "in 3-4 years" | Still not fully achieved as of 2026 | **Significantly overoptimistic** | [TechCrunch (Oct 2015)](https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/elon-musk-sam-altman-say-self-driving-cars-are-going-to-be-on-the-road-in-just-a-few-years/) |

## Safety Rhetoric vs. Actions

A notable pattern in Altman's track record is the tension between his safety warnings and OpenAI's deployment practices:

| Rhetoric | Action | Assessment | Sources |
|----------|--------|------------|---------|
| **2015**: "Greatest threat to humanity" | Founded company to build AGI | Tension acknowledged | [Blog post](https://blog.samaltman.com/) |
| **2023**: Signed extinction risk statement | Continued aggressive deployment | Critics call this performative | [CAIS Statement](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk) |
| **2023**: Called for licensing agency | Deployed GPT-4, o1 without waiting for regulation | Actions preceded policy | [Senate testimony](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/) |
| **2024**: "AGI will matter much less" | Continued racing for AGI | Shifted from doom to dismissal | [Bloomberg Businessweek (Jan 2025)](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-sam-altman-interview/) |

## Confidence Calibration

**Patterns observed:**

- **Vague language as hedge**: Uses "few thousand days" (could mean 5.5-14 years), "AGI as we have traditionally understood it" (undefined)
- **Moving goalposts**: AGI framing shifted from "transformative event" to "will matter much less than people think"
- **Overoptimism on timelines**: Self-driving (2015), specific product launches
- **Directionally correct on trajectory**: AI's general path and capital requirements

**Quote contradictions:**

| 2015 | 2024 |
|------|------|
| "Greatest threat to continued existence of humanity" | "AGI will probably hit sooner than most people think and it will matter much less" |

## Key Testable Claims to Watch

By **2025-2026**:
- Does OpenAI achieve anything resembling "AGI"?
- Do AI agents transform the workforce as predicted?

By **2029-2030**:
- Does superintelligence arrive within "a few thousand days"?
- Is 30-40% of work displaced?

By **2031**:
- Could AI-generated wealth fund \$13,500/year per US adult?
