This section documents the epistemic track records of influential figures in AI. Understanding where experts have been right or wrong—and their patterns of over/underconfidence—helps calibrate how much weight to give their current views.

## Available Track Records

| Person | Summary | Key Pattern |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| [Yann LeCun](./yann-lecun) | Strong on long-term architectural intuitions; underestimates near-term LLM capabilities | Consistent skeptic |
| [Sam Altman](./sam-altman) | Directionally correct on AI trajectory; overoptimistic on specific timelines | Safety rhetoric vs. deployment tension |
| [Eliezer Yudkowsky](./eliezer-yudkowsky) | Early timeline errors; vindicated on AI generalization; core doom predictions unfalsifiable | Updated from early overconfidence |
| [Elon Musk](./elon-musk) | Prescient safety warnings; consistently missed product timelines by 6+ years | Shifting goalposts |

## Methodology

Each track record page documents:

1. **Resolved predictions** - Claims that can now be evaluated with ✅/❌/⚠️ status
2. **Pending predictions** - Testable claims with target dates
3. **Unfalsifiable claims** - Positions that cannot be empirically tested
4. **Accuracy analysis** - Patterns of where the person is right/wrong
5. **Position evolution** - How their views have changed over time

All claims include source citations where available.
