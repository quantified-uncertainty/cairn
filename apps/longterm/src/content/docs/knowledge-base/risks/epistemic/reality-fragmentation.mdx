## Definition

Reality fragmentation is when different populations operate with **incompatible beliefs about basic facts**—not just policy disagreements, but disagreements about what is actually happening in the world.

## Distinction from Related Risks

| Risk | Focus |
|------|-------|
| <EntityLink id="epistemic-collapse" /> | *Can society determine what's true?* — Failure of truth-seeking mechanisms |
| **Reality Fragmentation** (this page) | *Do people agree on facts?* — Society splitting into incompatible realities |
| <EntityLink id="trust-erosion" /> | *Do people trust institutions?* — Declining confidence in authorities |

## Key Evidence

Cross-partisan news overlap dropped from 47% (2010) to 12% (2024). Large majorities now hold incompatible beliefs about basic events like COVID deaths, election outcomes, and climate data.

## AI Acceleration

Algorithmic curation → Each user sees different reality → Synthetic content provides infinite confirming "evidence" → Deepfakes fabricate "proof" → Feedback loop strengthens belief silos

## Overview

[Brief 2-3 paragraph description of this risk, its potential impact, and why it matters for AI safety.]
