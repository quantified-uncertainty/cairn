## Overview

Preference manipulation describes AI systems that **shape what people want**, not just what they believe. Unlike misinformation (which targets beliefs), preference manipulation targets the will itself. You can fact-check a claim; you can't fact-check a desire.

> **For comprehensive analysis**, see <EntityLink id="preference-authenticity">Preference Authenticity</EntityLink>, which covers:
> - Distinguishing authentic preferences from manufactured desires
> - AI-driven manipulation mechanisms (profiling, modeling, optimization)
> - Factors that protect or erode preference authenticity
> - Measurement approaches and research
> - Trajectory scenarios through 2035

## Risk Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Severity** | High | Undermines autonomy, democratic legitimacy, and meaningful choice |
| **Likelihood** | High | Already occurring via recommendation systems and targeted advertising |
| **Timeline** | Ongoing → Escalating | Phase 2 (intentional) now; Phase 3-4 (personalized/autonomous) by 2030+ |
| **Trend** | Accelerating | AI personalization enabling individual-level manipulation |
| **Reversibility** | Difficult | Manipulated preferences feel authentic and self-generated |

## The Mechanism

| Stage | Process | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **1. Profile** | AI learns your psychology | Personality, values, vulnerabilities |
| **2. Model** | AI predicts what will move you | Which frames, emotions, timing |
| **3. Optimize** | AI tests interventions | A/B testing at individual level |
| **4. Shape** | AI changes your preferences | Gradually, imperceptibly |
| **5. Lock** | New preferences feel natural | "I've always wanted this" |

The key vulnerability: **preferences feel self-generated**. We don't experience them as external, gradual change goes unnoticed, and there's no "ground truth" for what you "should" want.

## Already Happening

| Platform | Mechanism | Effect |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **TikTok/YouTube** | Engagement optimization | Shapes what you find interesting |
| **Netflix/Spotify** | Consumption prediction | Narrows taste preferences |
| **Amazon** | Purchase optimization | Changes shopping desires |
| **News feeds** | Engagement ranking | Shifts what feels important |
| **Dating apps** | Match optimization | Shapes who you find attractive |

## Escalation Path

| Phase | Timeline | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Implicit** | 2010-2023 | Engagement optimization shapes preferences as side effect |
| **Intentional** | 2023-2028 | Companies explicitly design for "habit formation" |
| **Personalized** | 2025-2035 | AI models individual psychology; tailored interventions |
| **Autonomous** | 2030+? | AI systems shape preferences as instrumental strategy |
