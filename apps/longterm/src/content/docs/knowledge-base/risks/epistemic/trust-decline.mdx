## Overview

Trust erosion describes the **active process** of declining public confidence in institutions, experts, media, and verification systems. While the current *state* of societal trust is analyzed in the <EntityLink id="societal-trust">Societal Trust</EntityLink> parameter page, this page focuses on trust erosion as a **risk**—examining the threat model, acceleration mechanisms, and responses.

> **For comprehensive data and analysis**, see <EntityLink id="societal-trust">Societal Trust</EntityLink>, which covers:
> - Current trust levels (US government trust: 77% in 1964 → 22% in 2024)
> - International comparisons and benchmarks
> - AI-driven acceleration mechanisms (liar's dividend, deepfakes, scale asymmetry)
> - Factors that increase trust (interventions, C2PA standards, media literacy)
> - Trajectory scenarios through 2030

## Risk Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Severity** | High | Undermines democratic governance, collective action on existential risks |
| **Likelihood** | Very High | Already occurring; AI accelerating pre-existing trends |
| **Timeline** | Ongoing | Effects visible now, intensifying over 2-5 years |
| **Trend** | Accelerating | AI content generation scaling faster than verification capacity |
| **Reversibility** | Difficult | Rebuilding trust requires sustained effort over decades |

## Why Trust Erosion Is a Risk

Trust erosion threatens AI safety and existential risk response through several mechanisms:

| Domain | Impact | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **AI Governance** | Regulatory resistance, lab-government distrust | Only ~40% trust government to regulate AI appropriately (OECD 2024) |
| **Elections** | Contested results, violence | 4 in 10 with high grievance approve hostile activism (<R id="1312df71e6a1ca40">Edelman 2025</R>) |
| **Public Health** | Pandemic response failure | Healthcare trust dropped 30.4 pts during COVID-19 |
| **Climate Action** | Policy paralysis | Only ~40% believe government will reduce emissions effectively |
| **International Cooperation** | Treaty verification failures | Liar's dividend undermines evidence-based agreements |

The core dynamic: **low trust prevents the coordination needed to address catastrophic risks**, while AI capabilities make trust harder to maintain.

## Responses That Address This Risk

| Response | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| <EntityLink id="content-authentication">Content Authentication</EntityLink> | Cryptographic verification of content origins (C2PA standard) | Medium-High |
| <EntityLink id="epistemic-infrastructure">Epistemic Infrastructure</EntityLink> | Strengthening fact-checking and verification systems | Medium |
| <EntityLink id="epistemic-security">Epistemic Security</EntityLink> | Protecting information ecosystems from manipulation | Medium |
| <EntityLink id="deepfake-detection">Deepfake Detection</EntityLink> | Technical countermeasures to synthetic media | Medium (cat-and-mouse) |
| Media Literacy Programs | Teaching source evaluation and critical thinking | Medium (d=0.60 effect size) |

## Key Acceleration Mechanism: The Liar's Dividend

The most concerning AI-driven dynamic is the **liar's dividend** (<R id="ad6fe8bb9c2db0d9">Chesney & Citron</R>): the mere *possibility* of fabricated evidence undermines trust in *all* evidence. Research shows politicians who falsely claim scandals are "fake news" receive 8-15% higher support than those who apologize (<R id="c75d8df0bbf5a94d">American Political Science Review, 2024</R>).

This creates a double bind where neither belief nor disbelief in evidence can be rationally justified—and the effect will intensify as deepfake capabilities improve.
