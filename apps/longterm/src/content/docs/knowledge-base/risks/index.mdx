## Overview

This section documents the potential risks from advanced AI systems, organized into four major categories based on the source and nature of the risk.

## Risk Categories

### [Accident Risks](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/scheming/)
Unintended failures from AI systems pursuing misaligned goals:
- [Scheming](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/scheming/) - AI strategically concealing misaligned goals
- [Deceptive Alignment](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/deceptive-alignment/) - Models appearing aligned during training
- [Mesa-Optimization](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/mesa-optimization/) - Learned optimizers with misaligned objectives
- [Goal Misgeneralization](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/goal-misgeneralization/) - Objectives that fail in deployment
- [Power-Seeking](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/power-seeking/) - Instrumental convergence toward acquiring resources

### [Misuse Risks](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/bioweapons/)
Deliberate harmful applications of AI capabilities:
- [Bioweapons](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/bioweapons/) - AI-assisted biological weapon development
- [Cyberweapons](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/cyberweapons/) - Automated cyber attacks and vulnerabilities
- [Disinformation](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/disinformation/) - Large-scale manipulation campaigns
- [Autonomous Weapons](/knowledge-base/risks/misuse/autonomous-weapons/) - Lethal autonomous systems

### [Structural Risks](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/racing-dynamics/)
Systemic issues from how AI development is organized:
- [Racing Dynamics](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/racing-dynamics/) - Competitive pressure reducing safety investment
- [Concentration of Power](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/concentration-of-power/) - Dangerous accumulation of AI capabilities
- [Lock-in](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/lock-in/) - Irreversible entrenchment of values or structures
- [Economic Disruption](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/economic-disruption/) - Labor market and economic instability

### [Epistemic Risks](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/trust-decline/)
Threats to society's ability to know and reason:
- [Trust Decline](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/trust-decline/) - Erosion of institutional and interpersonal trust
- [Authentication Collapse](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/authentication-collapse/) - Inability to verify authentic content
- [Expertise Atrophy](/knowledge-base/risks/epistemic/expertise-atrophy/) - Loss of human capability through AI dependence

## How Risks Connect

Many risks interact and compound. For example:
- Racing dynamics → reduced safety testing → higher accident risk
- Disinformation → trust decline → reduced coordination capacity
- Power concentration → lock-in potential → governance failures

See the [Risk Interaction Matrix](/knowledge-base/models/dynamics-models/risk-interaction-matrix/) for detailed analysis.
