## Overview

This page tracks the **size, growth, and resource allocation** of the AI safety research field. Understanding these metrics helps assess whether safety research is keeping pace with capabilities development and identify critical capacity gaps. The analysis encompasses researcher headcount, funding flows, publication trends, and educational programs.

**Key finding**: Despite rapid growth, AI safety research remains severely under-resourced relative to capabilities development, with spending ratios estimated at 1:10,000 or worse. The field has tripled from ~400 to ~1,100 FTEs (2022-2025) but capabilities research is growing faster, creating a widening absolute gap. Current safety funding represents just 0.0004% of global GDP, while AI capabilities investment exceeds \$100 billion annually. This creates significant questions about whether AI safety research can develop adequate solutions before transformative AI capabilities emerge.

## Risk Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence | Trend |
|-----------|------------|----------|--------|
| **Researcher Shortage** | Critical | 1:50-100 safety:capabilities ratio | Worsening |
| **Funding Gap** | Severe | 1:10,000 spending ratio | Stable disparity |
| **Experience Gap** | High | Median 2-5 years experience | Slowly improving |
| **Growth Rate Mismatch** | Concerning | 21% vs 30-40% annual growth | Gap widening |

## Current Safety Research Capacity

### Full-Time Researcher Headcount (2025)

| Category | Count | Organizations | Growth Rate |
|----------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Technical AI Safety | ~600 FTEs | 68 active orgs | 21% annually |
| AI Governance/Policy | ~500 FTEs | Various | 30% annually |
| **Total Safety Research** | **~1,100 FTEs** | **70+ orgs** | **25% annually** |

**Data source**: <R id="241ffc16c6786bd6">AI Safety Field Growth Analysis 2025</R> tracking organizations explicitly branded as "AI safety."

**Key limitations**: <R id="6c3ba43830cda3c5">80,000 Hours</R> estimates "several thousand people" work on major AI risks when including researchers at major labs and academia, suggesting significant undercounting of part-time and embedded safety researchers.

### Field Composition by Research Area

**Top technical research areas** by organization count:
1. Miscellaneous technical AI safety research
2. <EntityLink id="language-models">LLM safety</EntityLink>
3. <EntityLink id="interpretability">Interpretability</EntityLink>
4. <EntityLink id="alignment">Alignment research</EntityLink>

**Historical growth trajectory**:
- 2022: ~400 FTE researchers total
- 2023: ~650 FTE researchers  
- 2024: ~900 FTE researchers
- 2025: ~1,100 FTE researchers

This represents consistent 25%+ annual growth, but still lags behind estimated capabilities research expansion of 30-40% annually.

## Funding Analysis

### Annual Safety Research Funding (2024-2025)

| Funding Source | Amount | Focus Area | Reliability |
|----------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| <R id="dd0cf0ff290cc68e">Open Philanthropy</R> | ~\$10M annually | Technical safety, governance | High |
| <R id="9baa7f54db71864d">Long-Term Future Fund</R> | ~\$5-10M annually | Individual grants, upskilling | Medium |
| Government Programs | ~\$160M | Safety institutes, research | Growing |
| Corporate Labs | Undisclosed | Internal safety teams | Unknown |
| **Total Estimated** | **\$250-400M** | **Global safety research** | **Medium confidence** |

### Government Safety Investment

| Country/Region | Program | Funding | Timeline |
|----------------|---------|---------|----------|
| United States | <EntityLink id="us-aisi">US AISI</EntityLink> | \$10M | 2024+ |
| United Kingdom | <EntityLink id="uk-aisi">UK AISI</EntityLink> | \$100M | 2023+ |
| Canada | Canada AISI | \$50M | 2024+ |
| European Union | AI Act implementation | €100M+ | 2024+ |

### Capabilities vs Safety Spending

**Critical disparity metrics**:
- **10,000:1** ratio of capabilities to safety investment (<R id="9d9b64da39fc8be9">Stuart Russell, UC Berkeley</R>)
- Companies spend **>\$100 billion** building AGI vs **~\$10 million** public sector safety research
- AI safety funding: **0.0004% of global GDP** vs **\$131.5B** in AI startup VC funding (2024)
- Only **1-3%** of AI publications concern safety issues

**For context**: Global philanthropic climate funding reaches **\$9-15 billion annually**, making climate funding 20-40x larger than AI safety funding despite potentially lower existential risk.

## Field Trajectory & Projections

### Current Growth Rates vs Requirements

| Metric | Current Growth | Required Growth | Gap |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|-----|
| Safety researchers | 21-30% annually | Unknown, likely >50% | Significant |
| Safety funding | ~25% annually | Likely >100% | Critical |
| Safety publications | ~20% annually | Unknown | Moderate |
| PhD students | Growing but unmeasured | Substantial increase needed | Unknown |

### 2-5 Year Projections

**Optimistic scenario** (current trends continue):
- **~3,000 FTE safety researchers** by 2030
- **~\$1B annual safety funding** by 2028
- Mature graduate programs producing **500+ PhDs annually**

**Concerning scenario** (capabilities development accelerates):
- Safety research remains **&lt;5% of total AI research**
- <EntityLink id="racing-dynamics">Racing dynamics</EntityLink> intensify as <EntityLink id="agi-timeline">AGI timelines</EntityLink> compress
- Insufficient safety research to address alignment difficulty

---

## Key Uncertainties & Research Gaps

### Critical Unknowns

**Capability researcher count**: No comprehensive database exists for AI capabilities researchers. Estimates suggest 30,000-100,000 globally based on:
- <EntityLink id="openai">OpenAI</EntityLink> growth: 300→3,000 employees (2021-2025)
- Similar expansion at <EntityLink id="anthropic">Anthropic</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="deepmind">DeepMind</EntityLink>
- ML conference attendance doubling every 2-3 years

**Industry safety spending**: Most AI labs don't disclose safety vs capabilities budget breakdowns. Known examples:
- IBM: 2.9%→4.6% of AI budgets (2022-2024)
- OpenAI: Super-alignment team disbanded (May 2024)
- Anthropic: Constitutional AI research ongoing but budget undisclosed

### Expert Disagreements

**Field size adequacy**:
- **Optimists**: Current growth sufficient if focused on highest-impact research
- **Pessimists**: Need 10x more researchers given <EntityLink id="agi-timeline">AI risk timeline</EntityLink>

**Research prioritization**:
- **Technical focus**: Emphasize <EntityLink id="interpretability">interpretability</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="alignment">alignment</EntityLink>
- **Governance focus**: Prioritize policy interventions, <EntityLink id="international-coordination">coordination</EntityLink>

**Funding allocation**:
- Large grants to established organizations vs distributed funding for diverse approaches
- Academic vs industry vs independent researcher support ratios

## Data Quality Assessment

| Metric | Data Quality | Primary Limitations | Improvement Needs |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| FTE researchers | Medium | Undercounts independents, part-time contributors | Comprehensive workforce survey |
| Total funding | Medium | Many corporate/government grants undisclosed | Disclosure requirements |
| Spending ratios | Low | Labs don't publish safety budget breakdowns | Industry transparency standards |
| Publication trends | Medium | No centralized safety research database | Standardized taxonomy and tracking |
| Experience levels | Very Low | No systematic demographic data collection | Regular field census |
| Researcher ratios | Low | No capability researcher baseline count | Comprehensive AI workforce analysis |

**Most critical data gaps**:
1. **Industry safety spending**: Mandatory disclosure of safety vs capabilities R&D budgets
2. **Researcher demographics**: Experience, background, career transition patterns
3. **Research impact assessment**: Citation analysis and influence tracking for safety work
4. **International coordination**: Non-English language safety research and global South participation
