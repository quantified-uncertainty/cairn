## Overview

This section documents metrics and indicators that can be tracked to monitor AI safety progress and risk dynamics. Quantitative measurement helps move beyond intuition toward evidence-based assessment.

## Metric Categories

### [Capabilities](/knowledge-base/metrics/capabilities/)
Measures of AI system capabilities:
- Benchmark performance trends
- Capability emergence timing
- Task completion rates

### [Compute & Hardware](/knowledge-base/metrics/compute-hardware/)
Infrastructure indicators:
- Training compute trends
- Chip production and access
- Energy consumption

### [Safety Research](/knowledge-base/metrics/safety-research/)
Progress on alignment and safety:
- Publication rates and citations
- Researcher headcount
- Funding levels

### [Alignment Progress](/knowledge-base/metrics/alignment-progress/)
Technical alignment indicators:
- Interpretability coverage
- Evaluation robustness
- Safety case development

### [Lab Behavior](/knowledge-base/metrics/lab-behavior/)
How labs are operating:
- Pre-deployment testing time
- Safety team size ratios
- RSP adoption rates

### [Governance](/knowledge-base/metrics/geopolitics/)
Policy and institutional indicators:
- Regulatory progress
- International coordination
- Standards development

### [Public & Expert Opinion](/knowledge-base/metrics/public-opinion/)
Perception and discourse:
- Public awareness surveys
- Expert probability estimates
- Media coverage trends

### [Economic & Labor](/knowledge-base/metrics/economic-labor/)
Socioeconomic impacts:
- Automation displacement rates
- AI investment levels
- Productivity changes

## Why Metrics Matter

Good metrics help:
- **Detect early warning signs** of increasing risk
- **Evaluate intervention effectiveness** over time
- **Enable accountability** for labs and governments
- **Ground debates in data** rather than speculation

See individual metric pages for current values, historical trends, and data sources.
