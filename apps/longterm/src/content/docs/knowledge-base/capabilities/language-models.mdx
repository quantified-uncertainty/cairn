## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) are transformer-based neural networks trained on vast text corpora using next-token prediction, representing the most significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence history. Despite their deceptively simple training objective, LLMs exhibit sophisticated emergent capabilities including reasoning, coding, scientific analysis, and complex task execution. These models have transformed abstract AI safety discussions into concrete, immediate concerns while providing the clearest path toward [artificial general intelligence](/ai-transition-model/factors/ai-capabilities/).

The remarkable aspect of LLMs lies in their emergent capabilities—sophisticated behaviors arising unpredictably at scale. A model trained solely to predict the next word can suddenly exhibit mathematical problem-solving, computer programming, and rudimentary goal-directed behavior. This emergence has made LLMs both the most promising technology for beneficial applications and the primary source of current [AI safety concerns](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/).

Current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and OpenAI's o1 demonstrate near-human performance across diverse cognitive domains. With over 100 billion parameters and training costs exceeding \$100 million, these systems represent unprecedented computational achievements that have shifted AI safety from theoretical to practical urgency.
