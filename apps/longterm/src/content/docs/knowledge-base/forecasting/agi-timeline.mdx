## Overview

AGI timeline predictions represent attempts to forecast when artificial intelligence will match or exceed human cognitive abilities across all domains. Current expert consensus suggests a 50% probability of AGI development between 2040-2050, though estimates vary widely based on AGI definitions and measurement criteria.

Recent surveys show accelerating timelines compared to historical predictions. The <R id="efb578b3189ba3cb">2023 AI Impacts survey</R> found median expert predictions of 2045 for "High-Level Machine Intelligence," while <R id="8fef0d8c902de618">Metaculus prediction markets</R> aggregate to approximately 2040-2045. However, significant uncertainty remains around capability thresholds, measurement methodologies, and potential discontinuous progress.

### Timeline Acceleration Trends

Expert timelines have consistently shortened over the past decade:
- **2018**: Median AGI prediction ~2061

- Economic and regulatory barriers will slow deployment

**Timeline Optimists** (2025-2035) contend:
- Scaling laws will continue with current paradigms
- Emergent capabilities from larger models will bridge remaining gaps
- Competitive pressure will accelerate development

### Key Cruxes

| Question | Impact on Timeline | Current Evidence |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| Will scaling laws continue? | ±10 years | Mixed signals on diminishing returns |
| How hard is <EntityLink id="accident-risks">alignment</EntityLink>? | ±15 years | Ongoing research uncertainty |
| Can current paradigms achieve AGI? | ±20 years | Debate over architectural limits |
| Will regulation slow progress? | ±10 years | Emerging governance frameworks |

## Timeline Implications
