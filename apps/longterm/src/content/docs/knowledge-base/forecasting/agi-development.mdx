## Overview

AGI development represents the global race to build artificial general intelligence - systems matching or exceeding human-level performance across all cognitive domains. Current trajectories suggest median AGI arrival between 2028-2032, with development concentrated among 3-4 major labs investing \$10-100B+ annually. This concentration creates significant coordination challenges and [racing dynamics](/knowledge-base/risks/structural/racing-dynamics/) that could compromise safety research.

The field has shifted from academic research to industrial competition, with [OpenAI](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/openai/), [Anthropic](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/anthropic/), [DeepMind](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/deepmind/), and emerging players like [xAI](/knowledge-base/organizations/labs/xai/) pursuing different technical approaches while facing similar resource constraints and timeline pressures.

## Key Capability Thresholds

AGI development targets specific capability milestones that indicate progress toward human-level performance:

### Current Capability Gaps
- **Long-horizon planning**: Limited to hours/days vs. human years/decades
- **[Scientific research](/knowledge-base/capabilities/scientific-research/)**: Narrow domain assistance vs. autonomous discovery
- **Real-world [agentic behavior](/knowledge-base/capabilities/agentic-ai/)**: Supervised task execution vs. autonomous goal pursuit
- **[Self-improvement](/knowledge-base/capabilities/self-improvement/)**: Assisted optimization vs. recursive enhancement

### 2025-2027 Expected Milestones
- PhD-level performance in most academic domains
- Autonomous software engineering at human expert level
- Multi-modal reasoning approaching human performance
- Planning horizons extending to weeks/months

## Geopolitical Development Landscape

AGI development increasingly shaped by international competition and regulatory responses:

### US-China Competition
| Factor | US Position | China Position | Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| **Leading Labs** | OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind | Baidu, Alibaba, ByteDance | Technology fragmentation |
| **Compute Access** | H100 restrictions on China | Domestic chip development | Capability gaps emerging |
| **Talent Pool** | Immigration restrictions growing | Domestic talent retention | Brain drain dynamics |
| **Investment** | Private + government funding | State-directed investment | Different risk tolerances |

## Safety Research Integration

Critical gap exists between AGI development timelines and safety research readiness:

### Current Safety-Capability Gap
