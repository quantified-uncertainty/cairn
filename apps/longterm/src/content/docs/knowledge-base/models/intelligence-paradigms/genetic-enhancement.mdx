## Overview

Genetic enhancement refers to using **embryo selection**, **genetic modification**, or **selective breeding** to increase human intelligence. While this is not a path to artificial intelligence, it could in principle produce humans with significantly enhanced cognitive capabilities.

This approach is **extremely unlikely to produce transformative intelligence** due to biological limits, long timescales (human generation time), and profound ethical constraints. However, it's strategically relevant because it represents an alternative to AI for increasing overall human capability.

Estimated probability of being dominant at transformative intelligence: **&lt;1%**

### Current Technologies

| Approach | Status | Potential Gain | Timeline |
|----------|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Embryo selection (PGT-P)** | Available commercially | ~3-6 IQ points | Now |
| **Iterated embryo selection** | Theoretical | ~10-30 IQ points | 10-20 years |
| **CRISPR for IQ** | Not viable | Unknown | 20+ years |
| **Germline editing** | Technically possible, ethically prohibited | Unknown | Unknown |

## Key Properties

| Property | Rating | Assessment |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **White-box Access** | HIGH | Genetic variants are knowable |
| **Trainability** | N/A | Not applicable (biological) |
| **Predictability** | LOW | Gene-environment interactions complex |
| **Modularity** | LOW | Pleiotropic effects everywhere |
| **Formal Verifiability** | LOW | Cannot formally verify biological outcomes |

## Scientific Limitations

### Heritability vs. Manipulability

| Concept | What It Means | Implication |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **IQ heritability** | ~50-80% of variance explained by genes | Genes matter |
| **Polygenic nature** | 10,000+ variants each with tiny effect | Hard to manipulate |
| **Diminishing returns** | Best existing alleles already common | Ceiling effects |
| **Pleiotropy** | IQ variants affect other traits | Side effects |

### The Numbers Problem

| Factor | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Variants affecting IQ | ~10,000+ | GWAS studies |
| Effect per variant | 0.01-0.1 IQ points | Polygenic scores |
| Largest single variant | ~0.2 IQ points | GWAS |
| IQ variance explained by known variants | ~10% | Current polygenic scores |

### Key Insight

Even with perfect embryo selection among typical embryo batches (5-20), the expected gain is limited by the variance present. Multiple generations of selection would be needed for substantial gains—and each generation takes 20-30 years.

## Current State

### Commercial Services

| Company | Service | Controversy |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Genomic Prediction** | Polygenic embryo screening | Active |
| **Orchid** | Polygenic risk screening | Active |
| **23andMe (historical)** | Consumer genetics | Not for IQ |

### Research Programs

| Program | Focus | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **UK Biobank** | Large-scale genetic data | Research platform |
| **GWAS Consortiums** | Discovering IQ variants | Ongoing |
| **Iterated ES research** | Theoretical | Early stage |

## Ethical Considerations

### Major Concerns

| Concern | Severity | Explanation |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Eugenics associations** | VERY HIGH | Historical atrocities |
| **Inequality amplification** | HIGH | Only wealthy access enhancement |
| **Selection pressure** | MEDIUM | What happens to "unenhanced"? |
| **Consent** | HIGH | Cannot consent for future generations |
| **Unintended consequences** | HIGH | Pleiotropic effects unknown |

### Regulatory Status

| Jurisdiction | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| **Most countries** | Germline modification banned |
| **China** | He Jiankui case led to crackdown |
| **US** | FDA oversight of embryo modification |
| **UK** | HFEA strictly regulates |

## Why Not a Path to Transformative Intelligence

### Fundamental Barriers

| Barrier | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Generation time** | 20-30 years per generation vs. months for AI progress |
| **Biological ceiling** | Maximum human intelligence may not be that high |
| **Ethical constraints** | Society unlikely to permit aggressive programs |
| **Complexity** | Gene-environment interactions limit predictability |
| **AI is faster** | Any genetic gains would be outpaced by AI |

### The Timing Problem

```
AI capability doubling time: ~1-2 years
Human generation time: ~25 years

Even 10 IQ points per generation = centuries to match AI progress
```

## Safety Implications

### Potential Relevance

| Consideration | Explanation |
|---------------|-------------|
| **AI governance** | Enhanced humans might govern AI better |
| **Alignment research** | Smarter researchers might solve alignment |
| **Human-AI competition** | Enhancement as alternative to AI |
| **Timeline implications** | Won't affect near-term AI risks |

### Not a Safety Strategy

Enhancement is too slow to be a viable AI safety strategy. By the time enhanced humans mature, AI will likely have far surpassed human capabilities.

## Comparison with Other Paths

| Factor | Genetic Enhancement | AI |
|--------|---------------------|-----|
| Timeline to major gains | Decades-centuries | Years |
| Scalability | Very limited | Very high |
| Reversibility | None | Potentially high |
| Ethical constraints | Very high | Moderate |
| Current progress | Minimal | Rapid |

## Research Landscape

### Key Researchers

| Researcher | Contribution |
|------------|--------------|
| **Steve Hsu** | Polygenic prediction, BGI collaboration |
| **Robert Plomin** | Behavioral genetics |
| **Gwern** | Iterated embryo selection analysis |

### Key Organizations

| Organization | Focus |
|--------------|-------|
| **BGI** | Large-scale sequencing, controversial IQ research |
| **Genomic Prediction** | Commercial embryo screening |
| **Academic labs** | Basic research on intelligence genetics |

## Trajectory

### Arguments For Relevance

1. **Complementary to AI** - Enhanced humans might align AI better
2. **Backup option** - If AI development pauses
3. **Already happening** - Embryo selection is commercially available
4. **Long-term significance** - Could matter post-TAI

### Arguments Against

1. **AI is much faster** - No contest on timelines
2. **Ethical constraints** - Society will limit aggressive programs
3. **Biological limits** - May not be able to get very far
4. **Complexity** - Unpredictable gene-environment interactions

## Key Uncertainties

1. **What is the biological ceiling for human intelligence?** Some argue we're close; others think 50+ IQ points possible.

2. **Will society ever permit aggressive enhancement?** Historical eugenics makes this politically toxic.

3. **Could AI-assisted genetic engineering change the game?** AI might identify better targets and methods.

4. **Does enhanced intelligence help with AI alignment?** The problem may not be about human intelligence.
