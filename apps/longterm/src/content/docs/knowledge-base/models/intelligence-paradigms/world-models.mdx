## Overview

World models + planning represents an AI architecture paradigm fundamentally different from large language models. Instead of learning to directly produce outputs from inputs, these systems learn an **explicit model of how the world works** and use **search/planning algorithms** to find good actions.

This is the paradigm behind AlphaGo, MuZero, and the approach Yann LeCun advocates with JEPA (Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures). The key idea: **separate world understanding from decision making**.

Estimated probability of being dominant at transformative AI: **5-15%**. Powerful for structured domains but not yet competitive for general tasks.

### Key Components

| Component | Function | Learnable |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **State Encoder** | Compress observations to latent state | Yes |
| **Dynamics Model** | Predict how state changes with actions | Yes |
| **Reward Model** | Predict rewards/values | Yes |
| **Policy Network** | Propose likely good actions | Yes |
| **Value Network** | Estimate long-term value | Yes |
| **Search/Planning** | Find best action via lookahead | Algorithm (not learned) |

## Key Properties

| Property | Rating | Assessment |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **White-box Access** | PARTIAL | World model inspectable but learned representations are opaque |
| **Trainability** | HIGH | Model-based RL, self-play, gradient descent |
| **Predictability** | MEDIUM | Explicit planning, but world model errors compound |
| **Modularity** | MEDIUM | Clear separation of world model, policy, value |
| **Formal Verifiability** | PARTIAL | Planning algorithm verifiable; world model less so |

## Safety Implications

### Advantages

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Explicit goals** | Planning objectives are visible |
| **Inspectable beliefs** | Can examine what the world model predicts |
| **Separable components** | Can analyze dynamics, rewards, policy separately |
| **Bounded search** | Planning depth is controllable |
| **Model-based interpretability** | Can ask "what if" questions of world model |

### Risks

| Risk | Severity | Explanation |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Goal misgeneralization** | HIGH | Reward model may capture wrong objective |
| **World model errors** | MEDIUM | Errors compound over planning horizon |
| **Mesa-optimization** | HIGH | Planning is explicitly optimization |
| **Deceptive world models** | UNKNOWN | Could world model learn to deceive planner? |
| **Instrumental convergence** | MEDIUM | Planning may discover dangerous strategies |

## Current Examples

### Game/Simulation Domains

| System | Developer | Domain | Achievement |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **AlphaGo/Zero** | DeepMind | Go | Superhuman |
| **MuZero** | DeepMind | Games (no rules) | Superhuman |
| **Dreamer v3** | DeepMind | Diverse games | General game agent |
| **EfficientZero** | Tsinghua | Sample-efficient | Data efficiency |

### Broader Proposals

| System | Developer | Scope | Status |
|--------|-----------|-------|--------|
| **JEPA** | Yann LeCun | General intelligence | Conceptual/early research |
| **Genie** | DeepMind | World generation | Interactive worlds |
| **Sora** | OpenAI | Video prediction | Video generation (implicit) |

## Research Landscape

### Key Papers

| Paper | Year | Contribution |
|-------|------|--------------|
| World Models (Ha & Schmidhuber) | 2018 | VAE + RNN for world modeling |
| MuZero | 2020 | Learned world model without rules |
| Dreamer v3 | 2023 | General model-based RL |
| JEPA proposals | 2022+ | LeCun's vision for general AI |

### Key Advocates and Labs

| Entity | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Yann LeCun** (Meta) | Strongest advocate; believes LLMs are dead end |
| **DeepMind** | MuZero, Dreamer, Genie |
| **Meta FAIR** | JEPA research |
| **Academic RL** | Broad research community |

## The LeCun Critique of LLMs

Yann LeCun argues that:

1. **LLMs are "dead end"** - Don't learn true world understanding
2. **Autoregressive is wrong** - Predicting tokens ≠ understanding
3. **World models needed** - Must learn physics/causality
4. **JEPA is the path** - Joint embedding architectures

### Counter-Arguments

| LeCun Claim | Counter |
|-------------|---------|
| LLMs don't understand | They demonstrate understanding on benchmarks |
| Autoregressive is limited | GPT-4 does complex reasoning |
| Need explicit world model | Implicit world model may emerge in LLMs |
| JEPA is superior | No JEPA system matches GPT-4 |

## Comparison with LLM Approaches

| Aspect | World Models | LLMs |
|--------|--------------|------|
| Planning | Explicit search | Implicit (chain-of-thought) |
| World knowledge | Learned model | Compressed in weights |
| Generalization | Compositional planning | In-context learning |
| Sample efficiency | Often better | Often worse |
| Diverse tasks | Requires task-specific training | Single model, many tasks |
| Current capabilities | Strong in games | Strong in language/reasoning |

## Safety Research Implications

### Research That Applies Well

| Research Area | Why It Applies |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Reward modeling** | Explicit reward models are central |
| **Goal specification** | Planning objectives are visible |
| **Corrigibility** | Can potentially modify goals/world model |
| **Interpretability of beliefs** | Can query world model predictions |

### Unique Safety Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Reward hacking** | Planning will find unexpected ways to maximize reward |
| **World model exploitation** | Agent may exploit inaccuracies in world model |
| **Power-seeking** | Planning may naturally discover instrumental strategies |
| **Deceptive planning** | Could agent learn to simulate safe behavior while planning harm? |

## Trajectory

### Arguments For Growth

1. **Sample efficiency** - Much better than model-free RL
2. **Compositional generalization** - Planning combines skills
3. **LeCun's advocacy** - Major researcher promoting this
4. **Robotics demand** - Physical tasks need world models

### Arguments Against

1. **LLMs are winning** - General tasks favor LLM approach
2. **World model accuracy** - Hard to get accurate enough
3. **Computational cost** - Planning is expensive
4. **Limited success outside games** - Not yet general

## Key Uncertainties

1. **Can world models scale to real-world complexity?** Games are much simpler than reality.

2. **Will hybrid approaches dominate?** LLM + world model + planning combinations.

3. **Is explicit planning necessary?** Or do transformers learn implicit planning?

4. **How to verify world model accuracy?** Critical for safety but very hard.
