## Overview

This section analyzes different paradigms that could produce transformative intelligence. We separate **deployment patterns** (how AI systems are structured and used) from **base architectures** (the underlying neural network designs), recognizing these are orthogonal dimensions that combine in real systems.

A key insight: **scaffold code is more interpretable than model internals**. We can read, audit, and formally verify orchestration logic in agentic systems. We cannot meaningfully inspect transformer weights despite having "open" models.

## Deployment Patterns

These describe how AI models are deployed and orchestrated, independent of the underlying architecture:

| Pattern | P(Dominant) | White-box | Key Insight |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| [Minimal Scaffolding](/knowledge-base/models/intelligence-paradigms/minimal-scaffolding) | 5-15% | LOW | Direct API/chat; declining as agents add value |
| [Light Scaffolding](/knowledge-base/models/intelligence-paradigms/light-scaffolding) | 15-25% | MEDIUM | RAG, basic tools; current sweet spot |
| [Heavy Scaffolding / Agentic](/knowledge-base/models/intelligence-paradigms/heavy-scaffolding) | 25-40% | MEDIUM-HIGH | Multi-agent, autonomous; strong growth trend |

## Base Neural Architectures

These are the underlying model architectures, which combine with deployment patterns:

| Architecture | Status | White-box | Key Papers |
|--------------|--------|-----------|------------|
| [Dense Transformers](/knowledge-base/models/intelligence-paradigms/dense-transformers) | Dominant | LOW | Attention Is All You Need (2017) |
| [Sparse/MoE Transformers](/knowledge-base/models/intelligence-paradigms/sparse-moe) | Rising | LOW | Switch Transformers (2021) |
| [SSM/Mamba Hybrids](/knowledge-base/models/intelligence-paradigms/ssm-mamba) | Emerging | MEDIUM | Mamba (2023) |
| [World Models + Planning](/knowledge-base/models/intelligence-paradigms/world-models) | Research | PARTIAL | MuZero (2020), JEPA |
| [Neuro-Symbolic Hybrids](/knowledge-base/models/intelligence-paradigms/neuro-symbolic) | Research | PARTIAL | AlphaProof (2024) |
| [Provable/Guaranteed Safe](/knowledge-base/models/intelligence-paradigms/provable-safe) | Speculative | HIGH | Davidad ARIA programme |

## Alternative Substrates

| Approach | P(Dominant) | Timeline | Key Challenge |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| [Biological/Organoid Computing](/knowledge-base/models/intelligence-paradigms/biological-organoid) | &lt;1% | 2035+ | Far from TAI-relevant scale |
| [Neuromorphic Hardware](/knowledge-base/models/intelligence-paradigms/neuromorphic) | 1-3% | 2030+ | Not on path to TAI |

## Non-AI Paths to Enhanced Intelligence

| Approach | P(Dominant) | Timeline | Key Challenge |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| [Whole Brain Emulation](/knowledge-base/models/intelligence-paradigms/whole-brain-emulation) | &lt;1% | 2050+? | Scanning tech far away |
| [Genetic Enhancement](/knowledge-base/models/intelligence-paradigms/genetic-enhancement) | &lt;0.5% | 2040+ | Too slow for TAI race |
| [Brain-Computer Interfaces](/knowledge-base/models/intelligence-paradigms/brain-computer-interfaces) | &lt;1% | 2035+ | Bandwidth limits |
| [Collective/Hybrid Intelligence](/knowledge-base/models/intelligence-paradigms/collective-intelligence) | (overlay) | Now | Already happening |

## Interactive Comparison

See the [full comparison table](/knowledge-base/models/architecture-scenarios/table) for detailed property comparisons across all paradigms.

## Key Research Questions

1. **Will heavy scaffolding become dominant?** Current trends suggest agentic systems add substantial value, but reliability concerns remain.

2. **How much does base architecture matter?** If scaffolding dominates behavior, the underlying transformer vs. SSM choice may be less safety-relevant.

3. **Can provable approaches scale?** Davidad's agenda offers strong safety guarantees but faces capability-competitiveness questions.

4. **What's the interpretability hierarchy?** Scaffold code > symbolic reasoning > model outputs > model internals.

## Methodology Notes

- **Probabilities** are rough guesses, not rigorous forecasts. They should sum to ~100% for mutually exclusive categories.
- **White-box ratings** reflect current state of interpretability tools, not theoretical limits.
- **Trends** are illustrative; need integration with real publication/investment data.
