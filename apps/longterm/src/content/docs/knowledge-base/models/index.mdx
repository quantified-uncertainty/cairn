## Overview

This section contains analytical models that provide structured ways to think about AI risks, their interactions, and potential interventions. These models help quantify uncertainties, map causal relationships, and identify leverage points.

## Model Categories

### [Framework Models](/knowledge-base/models/framework-models/carlsmith-six-premises/)
Foundational frameworks for AI risk analysis:
- [Carlsmith's Six Premises](/knowledge-base/models/framework-models/carlsmith-six-premises/) - Probability decomposition for AI x-risk
- [Instrumental Convergence Framework](/knowledge-base/models/framework-models/instrumental-convergence-framework/) - Why AI might seek power
- [Defense in Depth Model](/knowledge-base/models/framework-models/defense-in-depth-model/) - Layered safety approaches
- [Capability Threshold Model](/knowledge-base/models/framework-models/capability-threshold-model/) - When risks become acute

### [Risk Models](/knowledge-base/models/risk-models/scheming-likelihood-model/)
Models of specific risk mechanisms:
- [Scheming Likelihood Model](/knowledge-base/models/risk-models/scheming-likelihood-model/) - When AI might deceive
- [Deceptive Alignment Decomposition](/knowledge-base/models/risk-models/deceptive-alignment-decomposition/) - Components of deception risk
- [Mesa-Optimization Analysis](/knowledge-base/models/risk-models/mesa-optimization-analysis/) - Inner optimizer emergence
- [Power-Seeking Conditions](/knowledge-base/models/risk-models/power-seeking-conditions/) - When power-seeking emerges

### [Dynamics Models](/knowledge-base/models/dynamics-models/racing-dynamics-impact/)
Models of how factors evolve and interact:
- [Racing Dynamics Impact](/knowledge-base/models/dynamics-models/racing-dynamics-impact/) - Competition effects on safety
- [Feedback Loops](/knowledge-base/models/dynamics-models/feedback-loops/) - Self-reinforcing dynamics
- [Risk Interaction Matrix](/knowledge-base/models/dynamics-models/risk-interaction-matrix/) - How risks compound
- [Lab Incentives Model](/knowledge-base/models/dynamics-models/lab-incentives-model/) - What drives lab behavior

### [Societal Models](/knowledge-base/models/societal-models/trust-erosion-dynamics/)
Models of broader societal impacts:
- [Trust Erosion Dynamics](/knowledge-base/models/societal-models/trust-erosion-dynamics/) - How trust degrades
- [Lock-in Mechanisms](/knowledge-base/models/societal-models/lock-in-mechanisms/) - What creates irreversibility
- [Expertise Atrophy Progression](/knowledge-base/models/societal-models/expertise-atrophy-progression/) - Skill loss trajectories

### [Intervention Models](/knowledge-base/models/intervention-models/intervention-effectiveness-matrix/)
Models for evaluating and prioritizing responses:
- [Intervention Effectiveness Matrix](/knowledge-base/models/intervention-models/intervention-effectiveness-matrix/) - Comparing approaches
- [Safety Research Value](/knowledge-base/models/intervention-models/safety-research-value/) - Research prioritization

## Using These Models

Models include:
- **Quantitative estimates** with uncertainty ranges
- **Causal diagrams** showing factor relationships
- **Scenario analysis** exploring different assumptions
- **Key cruxes** that most affect conclusions

See individual model pages for detailed methodology and limitations.
