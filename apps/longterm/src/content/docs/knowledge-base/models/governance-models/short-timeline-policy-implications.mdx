## Overview

"Short timelines" refers to forecasts from AI researchers that artificial general intelligence will be achieved within the next one to five years, rather than decades away.[^1] This is not an organization or movement, but a framing concept that has become central to AI policy discussions since the early 2020s. Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, estimates AGI will arrive in five to ten years, though his company has published research suggesting it could occur by 2030.[^1] Some researchers propose even shorter windows—one expert suggests AIs capable of replacing top AGI researchers could emerge by 2027.[^2]

These predictions have driven significant shifts in how policymakers approach AI governance. According to Jack Clark, head of policy at <EntityLink id="anthropic">Anthropic</EntityLink>, short timelines require "more extreme" policy actions, including increased security at AI labs, mandatory third-party safety testing to replace voluntary systems, and greater public discussion of dangerous AI misuse to convince policymakers to act.[^1] The concept has influenced major policy developments, including President Biden's 2023 Executive Order 14110 on AI (later rescinded by the Trump administration) and the EU AI Act's provisions for regulating systemically important foundation models.[^3]

Short timeline predictions have also sparked considerable debate about whether they reflect genuine technical trajectories or echo historical patterns of AI hype. Critics point to repeated failures in expert forecasting, including the 1972 Lighthill Report that criticized over-optimistic 1980s predictions for human-scale AI, and Japan's 1982 Fifth Generation project that consumed \$730 million (in 2019 dollars) but failed to deliver on hyped promises.[^4] Nevertheless, the concept continues to shape policy urgency across jurisdictions, creating tensions between those prioritizing rapid governance responses and those warning against premature regulation that could stifle innovation.

## History

### Early AI Policy Development (2020-2023)

AI policy emerged as a distinct field in the late 2010s, building on decades of AI technological development but driven by rapid advances in machine learning, deepfakes, and generative AI. The field focuses on regulation for safety, ethics, transparency, and governance. Several key technological milestones in the 2010s heightened awareness of AI's potential risks: IBM Watson won Jeopardy! in 2011, AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol in 2016, and the introduction of transformers in 2017 laid the foundation for modern language models.[^5]

The EU Artificial Intelligence Act, proposed in 2021, marked the first comprehensive AI law and became a foundational milestone for global AI governance.[^6] On October 10, 2020, EU leaders discussed the digital transition and invited the Commission to define AI, boost investment, and coordinate research.[^6] By November 29, 2021, the EU Council shared its first compromise text on the AI Act, addressing social scoring, biometrics, and high-risk AI systems.[^7]

In 2023, the concept of short timelines began significantly influencing policy actions. President Biden signed Executive Order 14110 on October 30, 2023, mandating safety testing sharing, fraud protection, and cybersecurity tools.[^6] On June 14, 2023, the EU Parliament adopted its negotiating position on the AI Act with a 499-28 vote, and by December 9, 2023, Parliament and Council reached a provisional agreement.[^7]

### The Trump Administration Shift (2025)

The Trump administration's approach to AI policy represented a sharp departure from the Biden era's emphasis on safety and oversight. On January 20, 2025, President Trump revoked Biden's Executive Order 14110, eliminating prior AI safety requirements.[^8] Three days later, on January 23, 2025, Trump signed Executive Order 14179, "Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence," redirecting policy via a cross-government AI Action Plan.[^8]

Throughout 2025, the Trump administration pursued an innovation-first agenda. In April 2025, it launched AI education initiatives for youth and Section 232 actions on critical minerals for AI supply chains.[^9] July 2025 saw the release of a comprehensive AI Action Plan, along with executive orders to prevent "woke" AI, accelerate data center permitting, and expand AI infrastructure.[^9] First Lady Melania Trump launched the Presidential AI Challenge and AI Education Task Force in August-September 2025, and the administration signed Technology Prosperity Deals with the UK, Japan, and Korea.[^9]

The administration's approach culminated in December 2025 with an executive order "Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence," which proposed federal preemption of inconsistent state AI laws and established an AI Litigation Task Force within 30 days.[^10] This created significant tension with states that had developed their own AI governance frameworks in response to short timeline concerns.

### State-Level Responses (2024-2026)

While federal policy shifted toward deregulation, multiple states advanced their own AI legislation in response to concerns about short timelines and their associated risks. California became a particular focus of activity. On September 29, 2025, California signed the Transparency in Frontier AI Act (SB 53), effective January 1, 2026, requiring models trained on more than 10²⁶ FLOPS to report risks, safety incidents (within 15 days), and implement whistleblower protections, with penalties up to \$1 million per violation.[^11]

Colorado's AI Act (SB 24-205), originally scheduled for February 1, 2026, was delayed to June 30, 2026, but still requires risk management, disclosures, and anti-discrimination measures for high-risk systems.[^12] Texas signed the Responsible AI Governance Act (TRAIGA) on June 22, 2025, effective January 1, 2026, banning harmful AI uses including self-harm incitement, discrimination, and deepfakes, with penalties ranging from \$10,000 to \$200,000.[^13]

However, not all state initiatives succeeded. In September 2024, California Governor Newsom vetoed the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier AI Models Act, which would have mandated safety tests and public cloud clusters, citing concerns about stifling innovation.[^14] This reflected ongoing tensions between those viewing short timelines as demanding immediate protective action and those concerned about premature regulation.

### International Developments (2024-2026)

The EU AI Act continued its phased implementation, with different provisions taking effect at different times. The Act entered into force on August 1, 2024, with no immediate requirements.[^15] General provisions and prohibitions on unacceptable-risk AI (such as government social scoring) applied on February 2, 2025.[^15] Rules for general-purpose AI models, including governance, penalties, and transparency requirements for systems like large language models, applied on August 2, 2025.[^15]

The majority of high-risk AI rules, including those for systems in biometric identification and medical diagnostics, took effect on August 2, 2026.[^15] High-risk AI in regulated products like medical devices will apply on August 2, 2027, with full compliance for public authorities required by August 2, 2030.[^15]

On February 10-11, 2025, France hosted an AI Action Summit where 61 countries signed an "inclusive and sustainable" AI declaration, though notably the UK and US declined to participate.[^16] In November 2025, the European Commission proposed a Digital Omnibus to simplify the EU AI Act and delay certain high-risk system requirements, though this required Parliament approval by August 2026, leaving many providers uncertain about their obligations.[^17]

## Policy Implications of Short Timelines

### Urgency for Governance Frameworks

Short timeline predictions have fundamentally altered the perceived urgency of AI governance. Jack Clark of <EntityLink id="anthropic">Anthropic</EntityLink> argues that if AGI might arrive within 1-5 years, voluntary safety commitments are insufficient and must be replaced with mandatory third-party safety testing.[^1] This perspective has driven calls for establishing security protocols at AI labs comparable to those at nuclear facilities, reflecting the view that short timelines leave little room for incremental policy development.

Experts emphasizing short timelines advocate for the establishment of international consensus on which AI systems would be unacceptably risky to build, along with international summit series on AI safety.[^18] There is particular focus on developing real expertise within Congress and the executive branch to handle emerging AI policy issues, given the compressed timeframe for developing institutional capacity.[^18]

Researchers have proposed that frontier AI labs should apply control techniques to their most advanced systems as quickly as possible and conduct internal security testing before external deployment.[^2] This reflects a view that short timelines demand immediate operationalization of safety measures rather than extended research and development periods.

### Risk Assessment and High-Risk Systems

The short timelines framing has influenced how jurisdictions categorize and regulate AI systems based on risk levels. The EU AI Act establishes a tiered approach, with different obligations for unacceptable-risk systems (prohibited), high-risk systems (requiring conformity assessments, risk management, and transparency), and lower-risk systems.[^15] High-risk applications include law enforcement, healthcare, education, and critical infrastructure—domains where rapid AI advancement could create significant societal impacts.[^15]

California's approach in SB 53 specifically targets "frontier" AI models, defined by computational thresholds (more than 10²⁶ FLOPS), reflecting concern that the most advanced systems pose the greatest risks if timelines to transformative capabilities are short.[^11] This computational threshold approach attempts to identify systems at the frontier of capabilities before specific dangerous applications emerge.

Colorado's AI Act focuses on algorithmic discrimination in high-stakes decisions around employment, housing, and services, requiring months-long impact assessments.[^19] This reflects a view that even if AGI timelines are uncertain, near-term deployment of increasingly capable systems in consequential domains demands governance attention now.

### Federal vs. State Tensions

Short timelines have exacerbated tensions between federal and state approaches to AI governance. The Trump administration's December 2025 executive order characterizes state AI laws as creating a "patchwork" of 50 state regimes that burden startups and innovation, risks First Amendment violations through compelled disclosures or output alterations, and undermines interstate commerce.[^20] The order specifically targets laws it views as forcing AI models to alter truthful outputs or imposing extraterritorial effects.[^20]

According to Adam Billen, Vice President of Public Policy at EncodeAI, the federal preemption effort represents a fundamental disagreement about how to respond to potential short timelines: whether rapid federal frameworks or state-level experimentation better serves safety and innovation.[^21] Ridhi Shetty, Senior Policy Counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, argues that federal policy should learn from state innovations rather than preempting them, particularly regarding protections for vulnerable populations.[^21]

The federal order threatens states with ineligibility for federal funds, such as BEAD (Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment) funding, if they maintain laws deemed inconsistent with national AI policy.[^20] This creates particularly acute pressure on smaller states, though California and New York have signaled intent to continue their regulatory approaches despite federal opposition.[^21]

### International Coordination Challenges

Short timelines have highlighted the importance of international coordination but also revealed significant challenges in achieving it. The 2025 AI Action Summit in France, where 61 countries signed a declaration on inclusive and sustainable AI while the US and UK declined, illustrates divergent approaches even among allied democracies.[^16]

Different jurisdictions have adopted varying regulatory philosophies in response to short timeline concerns. The EU emphasizes comprehensive risk-based regulation with the AI Act.[^15] The US under the Trump administration prioritizes deregulation and innovation-first approaches.[^9] China has implemented targeted regulations like the 2023 Deep Synthesis Provisions for deepfakes with government oversight.[^6] This fragmentation creates challenges for AI companies operating globally and potentially enables regulatory arbitrage.

Experts emphasize the need for establishing which AI systems would be unacceptably risky to build through international consensus, but short timelines compress the diplomatic timeframes typically needed to negotiate such agreements.[^18] The question of whether AGI might arrive before robust international governance frameworks are established has become a central concern in policy discussions.

## The Case for Short Timelines Driving Policy Action

### Evidence from Capability Trajectories

Proponents of short-timeline-driven policy action point to recent capability improvements as evidence that policy responses must accelerate. According to data from METR (formerly ARC Evals), AI systems have shown dramatic improvements in performing human-equivalent tasks: GPT-2 in 2019 could perform work equivalent to 3 seconds of human labor, early 2025 systems reached 1.5 hours, and Claude Opus 4.5 in late 2025 approached nearly 5 hours of human-equivalent work.[^22] The doubling rate for these capabilities was approximately every 4 months as of late 2025.[^22]

These capability improvements are not merely incremental—they represent potential phase transitions in what AI systems can accomplish autonomously. Some forecasters assign a 10% probability to AGI emerging by 2026 or 2027, which would enable recursive self-improvement to artificial superintelligence (ASI).[^23] Within the AI risk community, approximately 50% expect a "point-of-no-return" by 2030, after which AI development trajectories become difficult to alter.[^24]

Demis Hassabis's estimate of 5-10 years to AGI, combined with research from his company suggesting 2030 as a possible arrival date, represents a significant shift from earlier forecasts that placed AGI decades away.[^1] This compression of timelines has led researchers to argue that policy responses developed on the assumption of longer timeframes are inadequate.

### Lessons from Historical Policy Failures

Advocates for urgent policy action cite historical examples where delayed governance responses to emerging technologies created lasting harms. The rapid deployment of social media without adequate safeguards for mental health, privacy, and democratic integrity serves as a cautionary tale frequently invoked in short timeline discussions. By the time policymakers began seriously addressing social media's negative externalities, business models and user habits were deeply entrenched, making remediation far more difficult.

Nuclear weapons development provides another comparison point. The brief window between nuclear fission discovery and weapons deployment left little time for governance frameworks, resulting in decades of near-miss incidents and arms race dynamics. Proponents of short-timeline-driven policy argue that waiting for clear evidence of AGI's imminent arrival before establishing governance structures would replicate this pattern—by the time the need is obvious, the opportunity for proactive governance will have passed.

Jack Clark frames this as requiring "more extreme" policy actions precisely because of compressed timelines: mandatory third-party safety testing, increased lab security, and active public engagement to build political will for potentially controversial interventions.[^1] The argument is that if timelines are short, incremental policy development risks being overtaken by events.

### Risk Management Under Uncertainty

Even among those uncertain about specific timeline predictions, some argue that short timelines warrant particular policy attention due to asymmetric risks. If timelines are actually longer than predicted, premature governance frameworks impose costs on innovation and may need revision as technology evolves. However, if timelines are shorter than anticipated and governance is inadequate, the consequences could be catastrophic and irreversible.

This perspective drives calls for process regulations that have "negligible downsides like extra paperwork" but enable monitoring of frontier models—such as registering high-compute systems.[^25] The argument holds that under uncertainty about timelines, policies with low costs but high informational value about AI development trajectories represent prudent risk management.

California's SB 53 reflects this logic by requiring frontier model developers to publish risk frameworks and report safety incidents within 15 days, with whistleblower protections.[^11] These transparency requirements impose compliance costs but create informational infrastructure that would be valuable regardless of whether AGI arrives in 2027 or 2037.

## Criticisms and Counterarguments

### Technical and Methodological Concerns

Critics argue that short timeline predictions rely on flawed assumptions and historical patterns suggest caution. Claims like Leopold Aschenbrenner's forecast of AGI by 2027 depend on what skeptics characterize as "load-bearing leaps of faith"—including comparing AI capabilities to human intelligence despite acknowledged difficulties in such comparisons, and potentially ignoring the impending "data wall" that could limit further scaling.[^26]

AI experts have repeatedly failed to predict breakthroughs, leading to multiple "AI winters" in the field's history. The 1972 Lighthill Report famously criticized over-optimistic predictions from the 1960s that human-scale AI would arrive by the 1980s.[^4] Japan's Fifth Generation computer project, launched in 1982 with \$730 million in funding (2019 dollars), was hyped as revolutionary but ultimately failed to deliver on its promises, partly due to American exaggerations designed to secure competitive funding.[^4]

Some researchers argue that recent AI advances in specific domains do not necessarily generalize. A METR study on software engineering capabilities may not extend to other domains, and the pattern where humans find manual tasks easy while AI excels at white-collar work like PhD-level science defies earlier expectations about how AI capabilities would develop.[^27] This suggests that predicting AGI timelines based on current trajectories may miss important discontinuities or plateaus.

### Economic and Scaling Constraints

Critics of short timeline predictions point to potential economic limits on continued AI scaling. Current compute scaling may hit economic constraints by 2030, with some estimates suggesting \$1 trillion training clusters would strain even the US economy.[^27] If AGI doesn't arrive before these economic limits are reached, the argument goes, timelines are likely longer than short-timeline proponents suggest.

The "data wall" represents another potential constraint. Large language models have been trained on increasingly large portions of available text data, and some researchers question whether sufficient high-quality data exists to continue the scaling trends that have driven recent improvements. While synthetic data and other approaches may overcome this limitation, the uncertainty suggests caution about extrapolating current trends indefinitely.

Additionally, there remain fundamental uncertainties about making AI systems truly general, agentic, and capable of recursive self-improvement. Each of these represents potential bottlenecks that could extend timelines significantly. Critics argue that confident short timeline predictions underweight these technical uncertainties.[^28]

### Historical Patterns of Hype and Policy Manipulation

Some analysts draw parallels between current short timeline rhetoric and historical patterns where exaggerated threats justified policies that served particular interests. The "missile gap" claims of the late 1950s, later revealed as false, were used to justify nuclear weapons expansion.[^4] Similarly, exaggerations about Japan's Fifth Generation AI project in the 1980s secured American research funding.[^4]

Critics worry that short timeline narratives could rationalize extreme measures—such as nationalizing AI labs, banning certain research directions, or curtailing academic freedom—that might stifle beneficial innovation while failing to address genuine risks.[^26] These concerns are amplified by the AI field's historical pattern of marginalizing skeptics like Hubert Dreyfus, whose 1965 critique of AI was initially dismissed but later recognized as prescient.[^4]

The December 2025 Trump administration executive order characterizes state AI laws as forcing models to alter "truthful outputs" and imposing "ideological bias."[^20] Critics of this framing argue it uses short timeline urgency to justify federal preemption that primarily serves business interests rather than genuine safety concerns. The involvement of David Sacks, described as the White House AI policy czar, in proposing preemption with industry-favorable carveouts has attracted particular criticism.[^21]

### Alternative Policy Frameworks

Some researchers argue that short timelines don't necessarily imply that current policy responses are optimal. One analysis suggests that "short timelines aren't obviously higher leverage" because they don't guarantee faster takeoff speeds or better institutional response capabilities.[^29] Longer timelines might enable slower, more manageable intelligence explosions and provide more time to develop genuinely effective governance frameworks rather than rushed responses.

Others emphasize the importance of focusing on current and near-term harms rather than hypothetical future scenarios. This "anticipatory ethics" critique argues that excessive focus on short-timeline AGI scenarios risks premature value lock-in, loss of democratic control over AI development, and neglect of present harms affecting vulnerable populations.[^30]

AI researcher surveys show wide variance in timeline predictions, with no close agreement on short timelines.[^27] The median forecasts from these surveys often place full automation of complex work in the 2060s, with 50% probability of human-level AI in the 2100s according to some surveys.[^26] This lack of expert consensus suggests that basing urgent policy action primarily on short timeline scenarios may be premature.

### Concerns About Innovation and Fragmentation

Industry representatives and some policymakers argue that aggressive regulation motivated by short timeline concerns could stifle beneficial AI development. California Governor Newsom's veto of the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier AI Models Act in September 2024 cited precisely these concerns about hampering innovation.[^14]

The Trump administration's December 2025 executive order frames state AI laws as creating a problematic "patchwork" of regulations across 50 states, imposing compliance burdens particularly on startups that lack resources for navigating varying requirements.[^20] The order characterizes this fragmentation as undermining American AI leadership and competitiveness against adversaries.

Critics of this framing, however, argue it represents a "race to the bottom" logic where concerns about innovation constraints override legitimate safety considerations. Ridhi Shetty of the Center for Democracy and Technology argues that federal policy should learn from state innovations, particularly protections for children and vulnerable groups, rather than preempting them.[^21] This reflects a fundamental disagreement about whether regulatory harmonization or regulatory experimentation better serves society when facing uncertain but potentially short timelines.

## Current Landscape (2025-2026)

### Federal Deregulation and State Resistance

The policy landscape in 2025-2026 is characterized by competing approaches to short timeline concerns. The Trump administration has pursued comprehensive deregulation, arguing that removing barriers to AI development will secure American competitiveness. The July 2025 AI Action Plan outlined more than 90 actions across innovation, infrastructure (including chips and data centers), and diplomacy.[^9] In November 2025, the administration launched the "Genesis Mission" applying AI to scientific discovery.[^9]

However, states have continued advancing their own frameworks despite federal pressure. As of early 2026, 47 states had introduced more than 250 AI bills, with 33 enacted in 21 states.[^31] These focus particularly on healthcare AI, including chatbots for mental health, clinical care transparency, and payor use of AI.[^31] Eight laws specifically address AI chatbots, including legislation in Utah, New York, Nevada, California, Illinois, and Maine.[^31]

The December 2025 federal executive order proposing preemption has created uncertainty about which state laws will remain viable. The order directs evaluation of state AI laws for conflicts, proposes federal preemption for inconsistent laws, threatens ineligibility for federal funds like BEAD, and seeks legislative recommendations for a uniform national framework.[^20] Legal challenges to this preemption effort are expected throughout 2026, particularly from California and New York.

### EU Implementation and Global Divergence

The EU AI Act continues its phased rollout, with August 2, 2026 marking the application date for most high-risk AI obligations.[^15] However, proposed amendments under negotiation would tie certain deadlines to the availability of harmonized standards—potentially extending compliance timelines by 6 months after Commission confirmation for Annex III systems (with a backstop of December 2, 2027) and 12 months for Annex I systems (backstop of August 2, 2028).[^12]

These amendments have attracted criticism from civil society groups and center-left Members of the European Parliament, particularly regarding provisions they view as weakening GDPR protections.[^12] If the amendments are not adopted before August 2, 2026, the original, more immediate deadlines will apply, creating significant uncertainty for providers as they plan compliance strategies.[^12]

Globally, AI regulation is proliferating rapidly but with significant divergence in approaches. Korea is implementing a Basic AI Act, Vietnam enacted its first AI law, and China continues enforcing its 2023 Generative AI Measures requiring registration and content labeling.[^32] Gartner predicts that 50% of governments will enforce AI laws by end-2026.[^33] However, this proliferation creates challenges for companies operating across jurisdictions and raises questions about regulatory arbitrage.

### Safety Research and Capability Developments

The short timeline debate has influenced AI safety research priorities. Projects are underway to automate interpretability research, with the aim of accelerating safety work before potential points-of-no-return.[^24] Research focuses on unlearning dangerous capabilities, developing more sophisticated evaluations, and improving chain-of-thought legibility in AI reasoning.[^24]

However, critics note that safety research has often been operationalized into risk management frameworks rather than fundamentally slowing development timelines. The question of whether technical safety solutions can be developed and deployed quickly enough if AGI timelines are very short remains contentious. Some researchers argue that if AGI emerges by 2027, current alignment approaches are inadequate, potentially warranting calls for development pauses.[^23]

Meanwhile, capability developments continue to advance. Enterprise metrics are shifting toward measuring "tasks completed autonomously" through Multi-Agent Systems, reflecting growing deployment of AI in production environments.[^22] Major technology companies continue integrating AI capabilities across their product lines, with predictions of widespread AI UX integration by late 2026.[^22]

### Business and Institutional Responses

Organizations face mounting pressure to develop internal AI governance frameworks amid the evolving regulatory landscape. With accelerating federal executive orders, state legislation, and international requirements, businesses are urged to formalize AI policies addressing compliance, security risks, and intellectual property issues.[^34] This is particularly acute regarding "shadow AI"—unregulated employee use of AI tools that creates compliance gaps.[^34]

According to policy analysts, 2026 represents a year of "AI policy democratization" via courts, citizens, insurers, international bodies, and markets—not just traditional legislative channels.[^35] This suggests that even if formal policy development remains contested, other mechanisms will increasingly shape how organizations respond to AI risks.

California's establishment of the CalCompute public AI cloud consortium, along with NSF Convergence Accelerator Track F funding for disinformation-detection technology, represents government investment in AI infrastructure and safety research.[^24] However, no specific funding amounts have been disclosed for these initiatives.

## Key Uncertainties

### Timeline Prediction Reliability

The fundamental question of whether short timeline predictions will prove accurate remains unresolved. AI capability improvements have been dramatic in recent years, but historical patterns show repeated cycles of overoptimism followed by "AI winters" when progress plateaus.[^4] Whether current trends will continue, accelerate, or encounter unexpected barriers represents a critical uncertainty shaping appropriate policy responses.

The lack of expert consensus on timelines compounds this uncertainty. While some researchers assign significant probability to AGI by 2027-2030, surveys show wide variance, with many experts predicting substantially longer timelines.[^27] Non-response bias in surveys could potentially skew results toward those most confident in their predictions, whether short or long.[^26]

### Governance Effectiveness

Even if short timelines prove accurate, whether current policy responses would effectively address associated risks remains uncertain. Mandatory safety testing, incident reporting, and risk assessments represent procedural requirements, but their substantive impact on reducing catastrophic risks is difficult to assess in advance.

The question of whether governance frameworks can be established quickly enough if timelines are very short represents a particular concern. International coordination typically requires years of diplomatic negotiation, but if transformative AI capabilities emerge within 1-5 years, such coordination may be overtaken by events. Whether faster mechanisms for international agreement can be developed remains unclear.

### Federal Preemption Outcomes

The legal and political resolution of federal-state tensions over AI regulation represents a significant uncertainty for 2026 and beyond. The Trump administration's December 2025 executive order proposing preemption will face legal challenges, and the outcomes of these challenges will determine whether states like California can maintain their frontier AI regulations.[^20]

If federal preemption succeeds broadly, the question becomes whether a federal framework will emerge to fill the regulatory space, or whether deregulation will prevail. If preemption fails or succeeds only partially, the "patchwork" of state regulations will continue, with uncertain implications for innovation and safety. The role of federal funding threats (such as BEAD ineligibility) in influencing state compliance remains to be tested.[^20]

### Capability Development Trajectories

Uncertainty persists about which AI capabilities will develop next and at what pace. The pattern where AI systems excel at white-collar tasks but struggle with manual tasks that humans find easy has surprised many observers.[^27] Whether AI will develop genuine agency, ability for long-horizon planning, and capacity for recursive self-improvement—all relevant to transformative impact—remains uncertain.

Economic constraints on compute scaling, potential data limitations, and fundamental technical challenges in creating truly general intelligence all represent possible sources of timeline extension. Conversely, unexpected breakthroughs in architectures, training methods, or other areas could accelerate timelines beyond current predictions. The inherent uncertainty in these technical trajectories makes policy planning particularly challenging.
