This page collects discrete insights from across the project, calibrated for **AI safety researchers/experts**.

| Dimension | Question | Scale |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Surprising** | Would this update an informed AI safety researcher? | 1-5 |
| **Important** | Does this affect high-stakes decisions or research priorities? | 1-5 |
| **Actionable** | Does this suggest concrete work, research, or interventions? | 1-5 |
| **Neglected** | Is this getting less attention than it deserves? | 1-5 |

**Types**: `claim` (factual), `research-gap`, `counterintuitive`, `quantitative`, `disagreement`, `neglected`

See the [Critical Insights framework](/project/critical-insights/) for the theoretical basis.

## Adding Insights

Insights are stored in `src/data/insights.yaml`. Be **harsh on surprising** - most well-known AI safety facts should be 1-2 for experts.

```yaml
- id: "XXX"
  insight: "Your insight here - a compact, specific claim."
  source: /path/to/source-page
  tags: [relevant, tags]
  type: claim  # or: research-gap, counterintuitive, quantitative, disagreement, neglected
  surprising: 2.5  # Would update an expert? (most should be 1-3)
  important: 4.2
  actionable: 3.5
  neglected: 3.0
  compact: 4.0
  added: "2025-01-21"
```

**Prioritize finding**: counterintuitive findings, research gaps, specific quantitative claims, and neglected topics.
