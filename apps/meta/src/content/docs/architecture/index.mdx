## Data-Driven Architecture

CAIRN sites follow a data-driven pattern:

1. **YAML is the source of truth** - Entity definitions, relationships, metadata
2. **Build-time processing** - YAML → JSON for fast runtime access
3. **React components** - Consume JSON data for interactive UIs

## Key Concepts

### Entities

Everything is an entity with a stable ID:

```yaml
# src/data/entities/risks.yaml
- id: deceptive-alignment
  type: risk
  title: Deceptive Alignment
  description: AI systems that appear aligned during training but pursue different goals when deployed
```

### Path Registry

Entity IDs map to URLs, allowing content reorganization without breaking links:

```typescript
// Generated at build time
{
  "deceptive-alignment": "/knowledge-base/risks/technical/deceptive-alignment/"
}
```

### Components

Use `EntityLink` to reference entities by ID:

```tsx
<EntityLink id="deceptive-alignment" />
// Renders as a link to the current URL for that entity
```
