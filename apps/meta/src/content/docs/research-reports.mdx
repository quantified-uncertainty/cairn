Research reports are **deep-dive investigations** that serve two functions:
1. Comprehensive analysis with citations from authoritative sources
2. Input for diagram creation—reports inform causal models

**View all reports:** [/knowledge-base/research-reports/](/knowledge-base/research-reports/)

## Quick Reference

**Required Sections:** Executive Summary (table), Background, Key Findings, Causal Factors (tables), Open Questions (table), Sources

**Key Rules:**
- Use tables for factors/summaries, not bullets
- Escape `$` as `\$` in currency
- Include 3-4 Asides per report
- Dates without quotes: `createdAt: 2025-01-07`

## Report Structure

```yaml
---
title: "Topic Name: Research Report"
description: "One-sentence summary with data (escape \\$ signs)."
topic: "entity-id"
createdAt: 2025-01-07      # No quotes
lastUpdated: 2025-01-07
researchDepth: "standard"  # quick | standard | comprehensive

```

| Section | Purpose | Format |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Executive Summary | Key findings | Table |
| Background | Context | Prose + Aside |
| Key Findings | Results | Prose + tables |
| Causal Factors | For diagrams | Tables by strength |
| Open Questions | Uncertainties | Table |
| Sources | Citations | Lists by type |

## Causal Factors Format

<Aside type="tip" title="Critical for Diagrams">
This section directly feeds into cause-effect diagram creation. Tables ensure factors map cleanly to diagram nodes.
</Aside>

```markdown
### Primary Factors (Strong Influence)

| Factor | Direction | Type | Evidence | Confidence |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|------------|
| **Immigration Policy** | ↑↓ Topic | leaf | Evidence | High |

### Secondary Factors (Medium Influence)

| Factor | Direction | Type | Evidence | Confidence |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|------------|
| **Graduate Programs** | ↑ Topic | cause | Evidence | Medium |
```

**Columns:**
- **Direction:** ↑ (increases), ↓ (decreases), ↑↓ (bidirectional)
- **Type:** `leaf` (external), `cause` (derived), `intermediate` (direct)
- **Confidence:** High, Medium, Low

## Research Depth

| Level | Time | Sources | Use When |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| `quick` | 15-30 min | 5-10 | Initial exploration |
| `standard` | 1-2 hours | 15-25 | Most topics |
| `comprehensive` | 3-5 hours | 30-50+ | Critical topics |

<summary>**View Source Hierarchy**</summary>

| Priority | Source Type | Examples | Trust |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Peer-reviewed | Nature, Science, arXiv | High |
| 2 | Expert orgs | RAND, Brookings, FHI | High |
| 3 | Government | GAO, UK AISI, NIST | High |
| 4 | Journalism | Reuters, AP | Medium |
| 5 | Industry | McKinsey, OECD | Medium |
| 6 | Forums | LessWrong, EA Forum | Variable |
| 7 | Company blogs | OpenAI, Anthropic | Medium |

## Section Templates

<details>
<summary>**View Executive Summary Template**</summary>

Use a table, not bullets:

```markdown
## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **US dominance** | 57% of top researchers | US remains primary hub |
| **Policy risk** | \$100K H-1B fee | May accelerate brain drain |
| **Key uncertainty** | Immigration policy | Critical inflection point |
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>**View Open Questions Template**</summary>

```markdown
## Open Questions

<Aside type="note" title="Key Uncertainties">
These questions represent the highest-value areas for follow-up research.
</Aside>

| Question | Why It Matters | Current State |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Will H-1B fees persist?** | \$100K changes economics | May face legal challenge |
| **Is China's surge sustainable?** | 47% share may be temporary | Depends on retention |
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>**View Formatting Guidelines**</summary>

**Use Tables Over Bullet Lists:**
```markdown
# Bad (low density)
**Factor Name**
- Direction: Increases
- Type: leaf

# Good (table format)
| Factor | Direction | Type |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **Factor Name** | ↑ Topic | leaf |
```

**Escape Dollar Signs:**

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| `$100,000` | `\$100,000` |
| `$5B` | `\$5B` |

Also escape in frontmatter: `description: "Fees increased to \\$100K"`

**Use Asides Liberally (3-4 per report):**
```mdx
<Aside type="tip" title="Why This Matters">
Key insight about safety implications.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Limitation">
Important caveat about the data.
</Aside>
```

</details>

## Integration with Diagrams

| Report Column | Diagram Element |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Factor | Node label |
| Type | Node type |
| Direction (↑/↓) | Edge effect |
| Section (Primary/Secondary) | Edge strength |
| Confidence | Edge confidence |

**Workflow:** Report → Extract factors → Create diagram → Link both

---

## Quality Levels

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1-2 | Basic outline, 10-15 sources, gaps |
| 3 | Solid coverage, 15-25 sources |
| 4 | Comprehensive, 25-35 sources |
| 5 | Authoritative, 35+ sources, original synthesis |

---

## Validation

```bash
npm run validate:mdx
npm run validate:dollars
```

<details>
<summary>**View Validation Checklist**</summary>

| Check | Problem | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Dollar signs escaped | LaTeX rendering | `$` → `\$` |
| Dates unquoted | Schema fails | Remove quotes |
| Tables used | Low density | Convert bullets |
| Asides included | Missing insights | Add 3-4 |
| Sources organized | Hard to assess | Group by type |
| Links valid | Broken refs | Test URLs |

</details>

<details>
<summary>**View Common Mistakes**</summary>

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Bullet lists for factors | Use tables |
| Unescaped `$` | Use `\$` |
| Quoted dates | Remove quotes |
| No Asides | Add 3-4 callouts |
| Flat hierarchy | Use h2/h3 |
| Missing validation | Run validators |
