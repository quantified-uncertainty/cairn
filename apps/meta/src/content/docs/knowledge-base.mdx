This guide provides principles and patterns for creating knowledge base pages. **These are guidelines, not rigid templates**—adapt structure to fit the content rather than forcing content into a fixed format.

<Aside type="tip" title="Key Principle">
A well-organized page with natural flow beats a mechanically-filled template with sparse content. Prioritize substance over structure.
</Aside>

Pages can track which style guide they follow using the `styleGuideVersion` frontmatter field (e.g., `styleGuideVersion: "kb-2.0"`).

## Core Principles

### 1. Content Over Format

The goal is clear, substantive writing that helps readers understand risks and responses. A well-organized page with natural flow beats a mechanically-filled template with sparse content.

**Bad**: Separate "Case For" and "Case Against" sections each with one-sentence arguments
**Good**: Integrated discussion that acknowledges different perspectives as part of explaining the topic

### 2. Proper Hierarchy

Use h2 (`##`) for major sections and h3 (`###`) for subsections within them. Don't create 10+ flat h2 sections—group related content.

**Bad structure** (flat):
```
## Summary
## Evaluation
## Risks Addressed
## Core Problem
## Proposed Solutions
## Key Challenges
## Current Research
## Case For
## Case Against
## Key Cruxes
## Who Should Work on This
## Related Pages
```

**Good structure** (hierarchical):
```
## Overview
### Quick Assessment
### Risks Addressed

## How It Works
### Core Mechanism
### Key Challenges

## Critical Assessment
### Limitations
### Key Uncertainties

## Getting Involved
```

### 3. Avoid Redundancy

Don't add template sections that duplicate existing content. If a page already discusses critiques in depth, don't add a separate "Case Against" section saying the same things more briefly.

### 4. Cross-Linking

Every risk should link to relevant responses, and vice versa. Use the "Risks Addressed" table for responses and "Responses That Address This Risk" table for risks.

<Aside type="note" title="Backlinks are Auto-Generated">
The `<Backlinks />` component automatically shows pages that link to yours. Focus on adding outgoing links—incoming links appear automatically.
</Aside>

### 5. Use Visualizations Sparingly

Components like `DisagreementMap` can be confusing if the data doesn't clearly communicate something. Only use them when:
- The visualization adds clarity over prose
- You have meaningful, distinct positions to show
- The reader will understand what's being measured

When in doubt, use prose or a simple table instead.

## Page Type Patterns

The core principles above apply to all page types. Below are patterns specific to each type.

| Page Type | Key Question | Core Sections |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Risk** | Is this real? How severe? What can be done? | Overview, Risk Assessment, Responses |
| **Response** | What is this? Does it work? Who should work on it? | Overview, Quick Assessment, How It Works |

<details>
<summary>**View Risk Page Template**</summary>

**Recommended structure:**
```
## Overview
[2-3 paragraphs explaining the risk]

### Risk Assessment
| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Severity | High/Medium/Low | [Brief reasoning] |
| Likelihood | X% range | [Key factors] |
| Timeline | [When relevant] | [Conditions] |

### Responses That Address This Risk
| Response | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| [Example Response](#) | How it helps | High/Medium/Low |

---

## Why This Matters
[Detailed explanation - mechanism, evidence, examples]

---

## Key Uncertainties
[What we don't know that would change the assessment]

**Adapting to content:**
- **Well-studied risks**: More evidence, history, expert positions
- **Emerging risks**: More theoretical arguments, key uncertainties
- **Technical risks**: More mechanism explanation
- **Governance risks**: More policy context

</details>

<summary>**View Response Page Template**</summary>

**Recommended structure:**
```
## Overview
[2-3 paragraphs explaining the intervention]

### Quick Assessment
| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Tractability | High/Medium/Low | [Why] |
| If alignment hard | Value if alignment is difficult | |
| If alignment easy | Value if alignment is straightforward | |
| Neglectedness | Current attention level | |
| Grade | A-F | [Summary] |

### Risks Addressed
| Risk | Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| [Example Risk](#) | How it helps | High/Medium/Low |

## How It Works
[Detailed explanation of the approach]

### [Subsections as needed]
[Techniques, methods, current state, etc.]

---

## Critical Assessment

### Limitations
[What this approach can and cannot do]

### Key Uncertainties
[What would change the assessment—written as prose, not sparse tables]

### Different Perspectives
[Where experts disagree and why, integrated into the discussion]

---

## Getting Involved
[Who might work on this and what the tradeoffs are—written as prose, not just bullet lists]

---

## Related Interventions
[How this connects to other responses—with brief explanations]

## Related Pages

```

**Adapting to content:**
- **Technical responses** might need more detail on methods and current research
- **Governance responses** might need more policy context and implementation details
- **Institutional responses** might focus more on organizational landscape

## Writing Guidelines

| Guideline | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Arguments | Integrate into narrative, avoid sparse "Case For/Against" |
| Uncertainties | Substantive questions with context, not sparse tables |
| Structure | Use `---` to separate major sections |

<details>
<summary>**View Writing Examples**</summary>

### Arguments and Perspectives

When discussing disagreements, integrate them into the narrative rather than creating sparse "Case For/Against" sections:

**Sparse (avoid)**:
```
## Case For
### Argument 1: It Works
It works well.

## Case Against
### Counterargument 1: It Doesn't Work
It doesn't work well.
```

**Integrated (prefer)**:
```
## Critical Assessment

The effectiveness of this approach depends on several contested factors.

**Proponents argue** that [substantive explanation with evidence and reasoning].
The UK AISI's success in securing model access from major labs demonstrates this is achievable.

**Skeptics counter** that [substantive explanation with evidence and reasoning].
The resource asymmetry is fundamental—dozens of government staff versus thousands at labs.

The key uncertainty is whether [the crux that would resolve the disagreement].
```

### Key Uncertainties and Cruxes

Present uncertainties as substantive questions with context, not sparse tables:

**Sparse (avoid)**:
```
| Position A | Position B |
|------------|------------|
| Works | Doesn't work |
| Good | Bad |
```

**Substantive (prefer)**:
```
**Will they gain real authority?** Currently, most AISIs are advisory—labs
cooperate voluntarily. If AISIs remain advisory, their influence depends entirely
on maintaining good relationships. Meaningful oversight may require mandatory
pre-deployment evaluation through legislation, which faces significant political
obstacles.

## Components Reference

| Component | Usage | When to Use |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Tables** | Assessments, cross-references | Preferred for structured data |
| **EstimateBox** | Expert estimate ranges | Only with actual sourced estimates |
| **Backlinks** | Related page links | Always include |
| **DisagreementMap** | Position visualization | Rarely—prefer prose/tables |

<details>
<summary>**View Component Examples**</summary>

### Tables (Preferred for Structured Data)

Use markdown tables for assessments and cross-references:

```markdown
| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Tractability | Medium | Active research |
```

### EstimateBox (Use Selectively)

For displaying ranges of expert estimates with clear sources:

```jsx
<EstimateBox
  client:load
  variable="Probability of [Risk]"
  description="How likely is this?"
  unit="%"
  estimates={[
    { source: "Expert 1", value: "40-60%", notes: "Based on X" },
    { source: "Expert 2", value: "10-20%", notes: "Based on Y" },
  ]}
/>
```

Only use when you have actual sourced estimates—don't make up positions.

### Backlinks (Always Include)

```jsx
<Backlinks client:load entityId="entity-id" />
```

### DisagreementMap (Use Rarely)

This component often doesn't clearly communicate what's being measured. Prefer prose or tables for showing different perspectives. Only use if you have clear, meaningful positions that benefit from visualization.

## Examples

Good examples of different page types:

- **[AI Safety Institutes](/knowledge-base/responses/institutions/ai-safety-institutes/)** - Proper hierarchy, integrated assessment, substantive content
- **[Compute Governance](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/compute-governance/)** - Detailed policy response with good structure
- **[Deceptive Alignment](/knowledge-base/risks/accident/deceptive-alignment/)** - Risk page with assessment tables

## Common Mistakes

<Aside type="caution" title="Quality Check">
Review your page for these issues before submitting. They're the most frequent problems in PRs.
</Aside>

1. **Flat hierarchy**: 10+ h2 sections instead of grouped h2/h3 structure
2. **Sparse template-filling**: One-sentence arguments in Case For/Against sections
3. **Redundant sections**: Adding Case For/Against when the page already discusses pros/cons elsewhere
4. **Overusing visualizations**: DisagreementMap for every page even when it doesn't add clarity
5. **Bullet-point everything**: Lists where prose would be clearer and more substantive
6. **Missing cross-links**: Not connecting risks to responses and vice versa
