    [*] --> Healthy: E > 0.7
    Healthy --> Stressed: E = 0.5-0.7
    Stressed --> Dysfunctional: E = 0.35-0.5
    Dysfunctional --> Collapsed: E < 0.35

    Stressed --> Healthy: Intervention window (easy)
    Dysfunctional --> Stressed: Intervention window (hard)
    Collapsed --> Dysfunctional: Generational recovery

    note right of Healthy
        Self-reinforcing verification
        Consensus achievable
        Errors corrected
    end note

    note right of Dysfunctional
        Unstable equilibrium
        Small shocks can trigger collapse
        Intervention still possible
    end note

    note right of Collapsed
        Self-reinforcing distrust
        Stable collapsed equilibrium
        Recovery may be impossible
    end note
